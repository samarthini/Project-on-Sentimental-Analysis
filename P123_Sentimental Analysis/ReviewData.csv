0,"If to say in a nutshell, product is MORE THAN EXCELLENT.My experience say that many global brands maintains focus on their product but the box/packaging in which it is being rolled out from the manufacturing unit may not have the similar gauge of quality standard or same philosophy in making.  But, my experience in regard to ""Apple iPhone 4S"" is different.  Apple quality standards are very clear and much impressive as the box in which it was rolled out maintains the philosophy on par with the product.  IT IS GREAT. Really it is very difficult to throw away the box in dust bin.  Thanks for Apple philosophy.Coming to product, the mobile phone is simply lovable and any attempt to compare its quality may become futile exercise.  It has very strong points : Built -- This 140 gram mobile comes with incomparable built quality which is rated 100 for 100.  The built is so solid for looks and strong in reality.  Design --  Design is simply beautiful and scented with classic look by providing buttons for volume and ringer features.  Operating System -- Though a little bit time is required to understand the iOS, experience say that it is flawless, hang-free and more reliable. Display -- Though latest versions are technically superior than the display what provided in 4S i.e., 960x640-pixel resolution at 326 ppi, never this specification caused in opinion of older version or dissatisfaction. Hence, display quality is excellent.  Camera -- Quality of 8 mega pixel camera in real terms is amazing and maintains edge over many of latest versions. Truly unbelievable.  Sound -- Really great.  In a single sentence, my feel is that quality lovers have to desist themselves from addicting its quality. No quality is in its vicinity. Overall experience -- GREAT.On the other-hand, the mobile need everyday power charge for moderate usage. Of course, the plus point is that the heat experience on long use, which means continuous use for hour/s, is almost nil.The gadget is simply the replica of Apple's love towards its customer community.  I thank seller Cloudtail and Amazon for bringing this wonderful product."
1,"Ordered this product on 8th of July and I received it on 9th. Here are the pros and cons-Pros:1. Screen clarity is awesome.2. Superb call quality, Camera and Video Camera.3. Good Battery backup (Full charge almost comes till night)Cons:1. Phone starts heating after a few minutes of browsing, chatting or Internet usage (Don't Know whether its a software problem or hardware problem)2. Usable memory is about 5GB. Which is about OK for a 8GB phone.Overall I am very satisfied with the phone barring the heating problem."
2,"Pros : touch is great, phone response time is superb due to underlying OS.IPhone is much secure as compared to other phones as it will not allow unwanted malware or application getting installed and doing away with your data.Battery backup us good.Cons : The only issue which I faced in iPhone 4s us that when someone calls me , it says your phone is switched off, don't know if its a technical glitch.As a workaround, I have to restart or change it to aeroplane mode to normal mode and vice versa. My iPhone version is upgraded to IOS 9.1 but the phone is switched off issue still remains to bother me. My friend also have iPhone 4s and he is too facing the similar issue.8GB internal storage fills up very fast if you take few  videos only."
3,Can be A very good gifts to older peoples.... because They don't need much memory space..... Phone is very fast... Thanks to apple's high optimized OS..... look and feel is very rich..... Camera and video recording is superb.... With Vlc player app you can play any kind of videos..... Simply love it......
4,"Buy, if your Budget is below 13K.I am using the IPhone 4s for more than 10 months now, & i feel that if you are on tight budget & want to experience the IOS, then go for IPhone4s. (Note: If you could Spend little more for around 20K, then go for IPhone 5s).Pros: Great IOS, Superb Display, Easily 1 Hand fit, Gr8 Camera, Hardware quality top notch, Apple after sale service.Cons: IOS is slow & Hangs, as IPhone 4s is 5 years older phone; 3.5 inch screen size too small for 2016; Poor battery life, & most importantly storage is very very low (If you r planning to buy any IPhone, go for 64GB atleast).Overall, i am satisfied with the product, as this is my first IPhone :). As I said, if you r tight on Budget for 13K & want to buy IPhone, go for it, otherwise go for IPhone 6s or IPhone SE.Note: Apple has discontinued the production of IPhone 4s. So, I am not sure that the IPhone 4s will get IOS 10 update.So, who should buy this product.It's for the Apple fan, for those entering in the Apple Eco-system for the first time and offcourse bored with Android or windows.If you want value for money irrespective of OS, then go with Android."
5,"This phone has problems with the signal reception.Even when other phones are showing good signals , this phone is showing No Service coverage. I cannot use this phone at home, with the doors closed, even though my house is just 400m from the tower. I am facing lot of problems becoz i can't use this phone at home.Even when I am keeping this phone in my pants pocket, it is out of coverage ,when .I am in the heart of the city. I have taken this phone with the Apple Service Centre, but no improvements, still the issue persists..So better think before buying this phone"
6,"It was a wonderful feeling to have my first IPhone. To inform everybody I have used Antroid and Windows before. My previous handset was Lg Optimus L7 . Truely speaking IPhone/ iOS is in no comparison with Antroid and Windows. I was sick and tierd of Antriod handset frequently getting hanged and automatically running slow after 6 months of purchase. Specially Sumsung Grand and those mid range Antroid devices. I am using now IPhone 4S for almost one month and I have purchased it from Amazon at Rs 23000. Amazon provided delivery within 2 days in Kolkata.Excellent display,butter smooth, no hanging promlem, hd 8 mp Camera and last not the least very stylish and executive build quality not like those plastic crap Antroid devices even if you pay 40000 bugs of it. Go for Apple !"
7,Very good phone. iOS does not upgrade more than 9. But really nice for the time when it was released.
8,"Awesome phone at compare android and windows, only battery backup is low , but battery is good compare with android, I using this phone last 6 month , good phone at good price,  This phone run fast compare with android ,  Siri is very helping software because I only say and all command automatically done by Siri.  iPhone software Is very secured sending activities. , apple provide many sensor in this phone, others brand no have any function and software.  This brands is so good .  At reasonable price"
9,"Iphone 4S is good but ROM size is too low. why means they giving 8 GB of memory, in that 2.5 GB go for os and other apps take 4.5 GB for memory, balance you have near by 1 gb if you add some songs and viedos in itunes means entire 8GB gone. then you mobile wont work properly.so if you planned to buy iphone you must go with 16GB min memory.other then that, phone is ultimate................ every thing is super, its iphone 4s so SIRI is inbulit.if u brought iphone u came to know about SIRI. SIRI is chance less....................."
10,"I  got it  before  the  estimated date. It  was  so  quick.  The  phone  is  original. .I  checked  with  iTunes. .Apple id.  So, overall  it is  good  in  the  price  range.  Battery charging it  does  get  a  bit  heated. .but  so  did  my  previous  android.  I  give  it  4 stars.  I  am  happy  with  the  iphone."
11,"1 of the speaker is not working, maybe its a refurbished phone. Its alright for the pricing and to get the feel of the iphone. I do not want to go through the hurdles of getting it exchanged and all, so using it the way i received it. Amazon will be happy with the customers like me, for not troubling them for any small faults in the product."
12,"It's been 1.5 years now that I'm using this phone. It's nice. Got at a deal price here. Awesome and genuine. No complaints about the seller cloudtail or Amazon. This is the second iPhone I've bought from this seller and both are great. Happy buyer here.Regarding Apple products, close your eyes and buy. They are expensive but it's worth it when it comes to performance n is classy too. Cheers!"
13,"I bought an iPhone 4s White, 8GB  through amazon On 31/12/2014 after I got the phone two times were struggling to start with the screen unlock function and usage of the full charged battery is only less than 3 hrs that means battery is draining so fast, so please do the needful help of replacement this phone for me."
14,"I am regular customer on Amazon, I purchased a iPhone 4s 8GB after 15 days I came to know that one side speaker is not working also the return policy is expired now there no option to change/ replace the item. No doubt Apple is world class phone but Amazon should think on my case to replaced with new one since its defective. If not this is my last shopping on Amazon.in."
15,Nice Phone .Using for last 4 years .
16,"One and a half year and having issues with voice reception although it is used by my mother so no that heavy form of usage, still issues in reception airtel is the service provider in patna"
17,i purchase these for my comfort and other companies give smartphone on big display so i can't take in pocket and comfort for call.it's display is normal and total body is steel so no worry for broken any damage.and u all know about amazon it's give customer best deal for prize so i purchase these on amazon.
18,Ok
19,I reviewed after 4 years usage. look like new..
20,"Wow the phone is juz sturdy metal loaded with ios 8.3 with update ready to 8.4, overall performance is good though only 4.5 gb user mem is available for use. Got within 3 days in kerala. Best device for gifting some1 u value the most."
21,"somehow I prefer my Lumia phone. I can do so much more with it. Maybe with time I will get used to an Apple.Transferring contacts etc from a windows phone possible but numbers ended up garbled. Though I could still dial, sms etc with the garbled numbers. I just could not figure out the exact number."
22,What to say about apple...Its a well known brand. And the good thing is that apple used to updates its phones with latest IOS. Phone is working flawless. Games are running smoothly. Camera (8 MP) picture quality is nice even in night pictures.
23,Works fine with iOS 7 but hang a lot with iOS 8&9With 8gb you only get around 5 gb of memory which is insufficientBattery backup is not goodBut it's a durable phoneI face dropped it a couple of times but it's working fine not even a hairline scratch
24,"If you are looking for a simple and majestic phone,this is it.Awesome looks,easy to use interface,excellent camera and the most important thing-APPLE.Everything is as good as its price , but the only thing that hurts is the internal memory which is approx 5.5 GB in the beginning.In case that doesn't bother you,just go for it."
25,"I thought it would be a fake, but came out to be a Original iPhone, Amazon was quick to deliver though having used it for a while now, the only drawback is the battery life, hardly stays up for 3 to 4 hrs. with wifi it drains up in 2 hrs flat. Feels like it is a paper weight now."
26,"At first I was not sure to buy this phone or not seeing the other reviews..but now I'm happy that I bought it!! The battery does not drain too fast compared to other gadgets I've used,the phone's look is classy...it's really awesome!! Love it!! Yes it does heat up and I'm ok with it"
27,"I bought this in the month of October, a week after I saw the phone in hung state after I got up in the morning, It continued to happen though the phone is not used much with apps. I bought this for my Mom, she uses it only for Phone calls though it hangs. 2 days ago,  I found charger not working and used another charger of our iPhone 4s. But now the problem seems to be with phone charging pin. I'm not sure what to do... Totally crap one"
28,Good
29,"Just one word... terrific phone ..never experienced this amazing technology /..... first time iphone user ...this phone gives u world class feeling and ex...I just love it ...but just one thing is missing that is my warranty bill . I did not recieve purchase reciept to claim the warranty .someone please help m,e with this."

31,Awesome
32,"1) The iphone supplied is required to charge twice a day, which is abonormal for a new phone.2) The video is not stable and given shaky pictures when enabling face-time.3) Phone gets warmer and hotter just after 10-15 minutes of talk time."
33,"Product turned out to be as expected, quick delivery, was kept informed of the status, absolute clarity about pricing and no surprises encountered. A smooth experience, would recommend to all"
34,"Awesome product,, I was unsure whether to order online for a expensive phone online or should I go to maple directly ,,,However very happy to get a genuine apple product online"
35,"The phone has stopped working properly... N I feel that it's a refurbished phone, it's battery back is is very low"
36,"Good phone only mad of iPhone buyers will buy this, present now we are getting ₹5k only 4G, think before buying"
37,"It my first buy of any Apple product and I am impressed. After using Android based phones, I can surely say that using iOS is a different experience. The build quality is too good for the price I paid."
38,"Great services by Amazon by one day delivery. New company sealed product.I register to my iPhone ,Apple get one year warranty .but the main problem is battery backup get 6 or 7 hours mixed use."
39,"Great device, never hangs, amazing resolution & picture quality, strong body, perfect size for small or big hands alike !!!!"
40,Very much satisfied with the product. Far better phone than the other brands available in the market.Buy it if the prixe is not a matter and feel the experience. The product was delivered within 3working days. So satisfied with delivery also.
41,Iphone 4s rocks  .....but the Delivery was pathetic ARAMEX the worst Logistics I have ever seen finally after waiting for a long time I myself asking for my package but their Response was even worse.But I am happy with my Iphone .....
42,"15 days back i bought this phone on amazon. After using for some days, i found a problem in Camera of this phone. Some time panaroma mode doesn't work, some time Phone doesn't allow to save the edited photos, OR some time even Camera itself is not working."
43,Great Deal got from amazon @ amazing price and delivery commitment is awesome. If online shopping need to be done in future i will definitely for for amazon.in and always recommend to all my friends and relatives.
44,Was apprehensive about buying a phone like the iPhone online. However the experience has been great and the phone works just as any from the Apple store would.
45,Good phone
46,Got delivered in 1 day.(without even opting for it) packing of product should have been more better.rest every thing was gud
47,Only one drawback ie abysmally low memory but i purchased it for my mom and she's very happy using it. ios is very intuitive and easy to use.
48,"Awesome Mobile, sorry for delay Review"
49,Waste of money & price was too high
50,Nice product working fine since 4 years
51,good phone but battery life very poor..i am getting average 5hours with 3g
52,"Horrible product, its quite sad to see amazon selling this product on their website. The OS hangs, you can't pick calls often and there are several OS issues. Great phone otherwise, avoid this seller!"
53,"Very good product, Using this for last 5 months, it is working good. Very good service by Amazon."
54,"Iphone is getting too hot even in standby mode, Battery drains to quickly.While location services are on its getting Bizzare hot. If location services are on and you attend phone calls of 10-15 minutes then during last few minutes its impossible to tolerate heat near ears."
55,All good as expected nice packing but looks like opened before and then packed but its performing well in normal use not a high end performer
56,"Got my iPhone 4s within 3 days from Amazon. It was factory sealed original iPhone 4s, manufactured in March 2015. Any micro-sim card works in it. Superb camera and smartphone experiance. It's an Apple guys! Go for it!"
57,I am very satisfied with the Iphone functionality. Camera and Video is best but audio Quality is not Best.You can hear better in upgraded versions.
58,"I like apple packing. And the 1 thing i regret is like i had purchased it in INR 18500, and 3 days later the price decreased by 500 and i found the same phone on 18000 3 days later.I cried a lot"
59,I had purchased this product two days ago. It was a new phone no doubt of it I have checked online. But I had a problem with this phone it gets too hot on the right side of the phone. It may be a hardware problem. Otherwise the phone is okay...
60,"Speech volume is very low,making it difficult to hear clearly for both incoming and outgoing calls.The battery also seem to be used one as it discharges very rapidly.Pl arrange for necessary check up of the set at Kolkata,somewhere near Salt Lake."
61,I was supplied a Jailbroke device (couldn't upgrade and just went dead) - couldn't believe it was monitored and supplied through Amazon.
62,Nice product as advertised
63,The I Phone 4s cannot connect with other devices via bluetooth...nor can files be transferred to and from it using the data cable...also the voice of the caller can be heard very faintly during calls although the volume is set to the maximum..
64,Gifted this to my girl.Super Phone got it at a cheap price of INR 16700! Worth the price for sure..
65,"I think this phone did not come with IOS7. But my phone has IOS7 and it is not powerful enough to make the phone sing with IOS7. Unlike Macs, the phones cannot be downgraded to older systems. So I am stuck with an unresponsive phone. What a pity."
66,I can grade iPhone 4S at the level of 4 star.it is very use ful as phone as well as 3G net.It is more updated in compare to my iPad and is a very good friend for all time. Without any doubt anybody can choice it as no.1 in mobile and net connection

76,"It looks refurbished,a tiny air bubble on the diplay, hard to notice otherwise.Got some opinion from experts who told that this may be the returned product, refurbished by apple and thus sold on discount."
77,"itz showing good performance. the only problem that i faced is ' getting heat while charging'. As it is common for all smartphones, 4s is money worth. go for it."
78,iPhone 4s battery is very low quality product. Always you have to charge your mobile and you will getting frustrated where to charge and u have to keep the charger evrey where you travel.

553,"Well an iphone is an iphone at the end of the day... and when you get an iphone 4s with ios7 pre-installed, what more could you ask for... and kudos to amazon for such prompt delivery and nice packaging of the product...The only downside is the battery of the phone... not powerful enough... other wise a good buy..."
554,"I had got the product in time.no complaints everthe  camera is working perfectly to take good shots.***important......their is no problem to take iphones in a lower price via amazon.as u see the prices are decreasing gradually ,but their is no problem in the condition,it is always new and not a used or factory refurbished iphone.i had got the phone whose manufacture date is aug 2014 with ios 7.1.2 which means it is a fresh or a new stock."
555,"unfortunately i received a  defective product with no much incoming and ring tone volume.so returned the product , amazon refunded the whole money.so love to shop back again with amazon.!!iphone is a good  phone if you get within 15k .The 8 GB is inadequate considering the os and preinstalled aaps take more than 3 gb.the phone is not as user friendly as android ones.battery too inadequate hardly reaches one day.so better try other makes."
556,Happy with the phone. Well it's an iphone so no complains so far. Initially I was a bit skeptical about buying the iPhone online... but it's pretty satisfying and honestly it's a good deal by Amazon.. One drawback I have experienced so far is the phone heats up while u play a game or even when it's charging. But I have learnt from my friends who use an iPhone that it's a normal thing... Go for it !!! Cheers
557,"Its very good phone. Touch response is excellent and best in the price range.Its UI is not very easy to use, it needs a little time (1~2 days) to understand.Camera is decent, not the best as hyped. I saw NOISE in the photos.Though it has DUAL core processor, its very very powerful and ""Iphone 4s"" will get""iOS 8"" as upcoming OS upgrade.You will lots of quality apps for IOS compared to other platforms.I bought it for my dad, he can't use 5inch phones.Apple is QUALITY PHONE and also STATUS SYMBOL in my opinion.I own Sony and Samsung android phone. I am hardcore SONY FAN.Sony's UI is very easy to use among Sony, Samsung & Apple.Samsung's camera is excellent among the above three.But Sony phones suck at low light shooting, they fail at processing image.""Apple iPhone 4s"" uses SONY's sensor and ""G"" lens on their mobiles.Conclusion: Super Quality phone with minor flaws."
558,# Explain why you liked or disliked this product.- Its the only phone which have a perfect shape and size.- Its the only phone with a centre button and a square logo on it #epicDesignWhat is Your Smartphone Thumb Zone?[...]# Compare to similar products and share how long you've used this product.I have been using this product for more than a years now and nothing compares to it.# Identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort & fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.- The battery is little weak but if you use it carefully even 1% lasted for half a day- I have no plans to upgrade it to other phones because its perfect and legendary. I am now considering upgradation to iPhone SE (Why did they put the headphone jack at the bottom??)NEXT: Why you should use a phone with both hands.[...]Why is the headphone jack on the bottom?[...]
559,"I love apple products... Just because of their smoothness, reliability & performance... I bought iPhone 4s from amazon just perfect and on time i.e. 2 days agoThis is a honest review about the product...Pros:1) its performance is perfect as usual no doubt.2) rear camera is good in bright conditions and many lo light conditions3) app performance is just soo good4) better battery backup5) excellent touch and displayCons:1) OVERHEATING issue which many of the users are worried with right now, its a common problem now trending in iphone users in our india this is just because of the hardware design of the phone and charger. Many people are worried that it overheats while charging but according to apple it is designed to work under temperatures of 0 - 30 degrees. so if its overheating please avoid it.I RESOLVED this OVERHEATING issue by using the apple charger with an input supply of around 110-160 volts with help of a voltage adapter.You may use computer or laptop to charge an iphone there's no HEATING issue"
560,"Except for the 8 GB everything is great.Fair warning if you are coming from Android, apps are quite heavy and 8 GB wouldn't be sufficient for most.I'd recommend buying a 16 GB phone."
561,"Phone received in good condition. Packaging was good and secured. It arrived within three days of placing order. Quick service.Phone received as expected without any issues, only the problem is with its storage space which is mention as 8GB but in actual it has only 6GB. After installing few apps the space reduced to 4GB and later after transferring video songs and MP3 songs it came to 1.5GB. The phone was preinstalled with iOS 8.1.2 which is working smoothly and fine without any issues till date. New iOS 8.1.3 is available but I have not installed it since it requires space of 1.5GB, which is not worth as the phone is working fine with its preinstalled iOS. I don't want to spoil the performance by updating it. Phone is handy swift sleek and good looking keeping the standards of an apple iPhone. Battery backup in normal use is good, no need to charge it after charging it once. But while using 3G it lasts only for 3 hours. So I keep a Sony power bank all the time with me to compensate the battery dryness. Few of the times I even spoke with the apple customer care for details and using of iTunes and updating software and they help me a lot to resolve the issues without any hassle. Must say, apple customer care people knows the value of customer service and feedbacks. Initially I was afraid to buy this after reading a lot of negative reviews but I must be lucky to got a good one without any technical faults yet. In looks, no other iPhone like 5,6 can be better than iPhone 4S. 4s is a truely good looking phone with metal strips around and glass in front and back. Touch screen is simply awesome and feel like nothing other to use. I must say, everybody should try an iPhone once."
562,There is Hanging Problem in Apple I Phone- 4s.software was not updated.it is not seems to be orifinal one. They were cheated me. I want replace this mobile very soon. Amazon guide me for replace. My mobile number is 9717575123.RegardsAnkur Gupta
563,"I am thankful to Amazon for delivering the 4s right on time as committed. Condition was as per specification i.e. a brand new phone with 1 year manufacture warranty along with mentioned accessories.Phone is really very good with simple and easy interface. The phone is fast even though the ram is 512 MB. No lag whatsoever you do whether you are surfing net, working on multiple applications or anything else, gaming etc. I have been using it since past one month and am very happy with it. Voice clarity is also good while calling. Even through FACETIME. When connected to 3g or wifi network surfing is a breeze.So overall satisfied with my Iphon4S and thanks to Amazon for a wonderful shopping experience. Keep going..."
564,"In my opinion, it's one of the best Apple iPhone's so far. Its the perfect size, unlike the 5(s and c) series, which I find are a bit too large.It runs IOS 7 without any difficulties. Its quite sturdy too, unlike what many people say about Apple. I've dropped it once or twice and there are no problems with it. The battery life is quite good too. It can run for a complete day even when you use apps like Soundcloud , Facebook and all on it for 3-4 hours a day.The camera is another very good point. Although the front camera's pictures can be a bit grainy if you use certain filters i.e  a few ones provided by 3rd party apps like RetricaPeople who are considering this, don't hesitate, this won't go out of line for at least an year! Apple is going update this to IOS 8 too when iPhone 6 releases."
565,It's been more than 8 months now.. it has some serious issue with the audio cant play it in loudspeaker mode..& it lags as you upgrade the ios .. possibly stick to lower ios versions.. Device gets heaten up whn used over 3G or wifi or after some time of browsing experience ..Also the device is very fragile must buy case with it
566,I received the phone & its hanging & not going beyond select ur language.
567,"As i buy an iPhone so there is No comment on Product........... its simply superb......The Product i receive is  100% Genuine, New & its OK...But this time delivery time is too long.........Actually i Order 3 Product Phone + Screen Guard + Cover but all the product come one by one.... In tracking its clearly show that my ordered product is already reach at my city, but still its take 2 days to deliver to my........So delivery is slight delay........ But product they delivered is 100% OK"
568,"Gr8 pricing and original product. happy to be an onliner thanks to Amazon :)spreading smiles through happy shopping experiences. (: apple products are always dependable and getting a case and scratchguard after 2 yers of its launch doesnt happen that easily with other brands, with the iphone you'll be spoilt for choice, rest assured!!"
569,Get the original iPhone wao........... Really love it. Apple Packed this phone nicely.
570,"Brand new one..Wonderful UI and it's really butter smooth ...Good battery backup - easily stands for more than a day without much usageOnly drawback is the space available. Out of 8GB, OS occupies 2GB and all app installs eat up the remaining.Overall it's very good for people looking for decent screen size and holding in hand factor."
571,"Phone comes with good IOS & lot more to offer with very best price . but the biggest problem is this phone is not compatible to IOS 8.1.2  (phone will start heating up after 15-20 mins of Data usage,or gaming or chat on whats app)kindly suggest to get rid of this hitting issue , otherwise overall cell has everything as mentioned in the specifications."
572,"Cheating by Amazon. Bought iPhone 4s white 8gb. First call I make using this phone, can hardly hear voice of caller,  speaker problem. Put on speaker phone the other side can't hear you,  mic problem. Charged the phone 100%, 2 hours without touching the phone the battery runs down to 10%.Feel like old used defective phone packed in new box and delivered."
573,"A good phone even today . Battery backup is good, approx 8-10 hours(active) + 20 hours (standby) . No over heating issues seen as seen written in certain reviews . It has been almost 2 weeks of usage and there has been no issue . Retina display is quite impressive . The software ios7.1.2 works seamlessly . Games like Subway surfer works smoothly . Camera quality is brilliant . The phone i received was manufactured in 2014, so it is a brand new phone and is still in production . Amazon delivery is also great ."
574,omg! iphonez here i ordered it on  3rd sept. n received it by 5th sept. 2014 morning ! really fast delivered on cod ! the phone is like awsm ! everything gr8! working ! don't be tensed about the product it comes with proper apple factory packing! n all stuff headphones charger n yes the divide iPhone works just gr8!  however the amazon packing was not tat good but still every thing inside wass all well but i ordered the product at rs.18229! n now its 17000 only ! so hurry up guys ! n hess i love u amazon for this n tanq ! :)
575,"Ordered this on 28th May 2015 and I got the product on June 1st. The courier service was excellent.I found some issues with this product. .1)battery drains quickly...battery life is around 6 to 7 hrs in 3G. ..2)it heats like an iron box while charging....also it heats a lot when using camera....3)when I updated to ios 8.3,it slightly  hangs when I open WhatsApp,Facebook or any other apps...These are the main issues that I faced while using this product. .Advantages1)good looking..2)camera,display and audio clarity are excellent..My rating for this product is 3/5"
576,They have an excellent delivery system. Extremely happy with the delivery system. When I got the phone I was unable to hear things properly. I thought it was not working well. But the problem is there is a plastic layer on the screen you have to remove it and then things will be fine.
577,One star deducted becoz of d unexpected late delivery..otherwise it's gud..genuine new product..
578,"Pros:1) Awesome build quality.2) One of the best designed phone.3) Amazing sound quality through speaker, loudspeaker and headset.4) Excellent display is the best part.5) Updated to iOS 9.Cons:1) Apple doesn't provides access to files directly. You need a PC with latest version of iTunes installed. So you need to move songs and files from PC to phone and vice versa.2) Not upgradeable to iOS 10 since it launched in 2011. That means decreasing apps support.3) Comes with proprietory charging and data syncing cable. So take of the care of those."
579,Good phone overall but lacks storage capacity. Apple has chosen this product wisely for Indian customers driven by price but keen on showing off. iOS 7 works Okay on the phone.Overall Satisfactory buy.
580,Excellent service from amazon...completely satisfied with the product...i am happy to get the iPhone at such a price...keep rocking amazon.
581,it is hanging a lot....... it came with so many scratchBUT NOW I WILL NEVER BUY ANY PRODUCT FROM  AMAZONEI HATE YOU BLUDY CHEATERS
582,Not bad ...Satisfied with the delivery time ..Bt when I opened my apple 4s .. And started charging my phone .. My happiness when off into the air ... Because my charger was nt working and I got the dummy on
583,"This a pathetic phone, I have purchased this on 12th May. This phone is too slow & I am using only incoming & outgoing. It's consume much space to install any application & you can't enjoy  WhatsApp, hike & browsing are very slow.My major concern is 'touch', I don't thing that this is original iPhone because touch is like a ordenary phone."
584,Good
585,GOOD BUT MOBILE IS GETTING HEATED UP WHEN CHARGING WITH ADAPTER AND NORMAL WITH SYSTEM CONNECTED CHARGING.CAN ANY ONE HELP ME WHAT COULD BE THE PROBLEM

670,I bought my first iPhone and that was 4S. I got the delivery late (more than 12 days) but when i received it i found it to be very good looking phone which made me forget the delay.Later i discovered that one of the speaker wasn't functional when i tested it by pressing the other speaker. I was highly disappointed as because it was more than a month & i was helpless.Very bad experienceHighly dissatisfied..
671,Everything is good apart that it gets heated specially during charging. Rest everything works fine.excellent service ! ! ! !
672,nice first experience with iphone! value for money and touch is just superb and unmatched by any competition.Only issue is with battery life. It does not last even a day with minimum voice and data usage! Not sure why apple did not address this in 4S ??????  ipod and ipad have excellent battery back up with my previous experience.
673,I like to take two mobiles by emi basis cn any 1 plz suggest me hw
674,Very beautiful stunning looking phone...Positives:Latest iOS....Awesome Display...Plays all the latest games smoothly...No LagReally really great camera and listening to music is always a pleasure.Negatives:Need to keep a eye on battery when playing games....

684,Good
685,I m in USA . I want pay by credit card it doesn't go through.
686,Almost fake phone. Neither the camera works properly nor the phone . And it hangs too much. Apart from this the net connectivity is worst.
687,this is not expected from  amazon......i hate ..
688,What the heck!!Iphone 4s 8 gb of 20 kAnd iphone 5s 16 gb space gray of 21 kAmazon plzz look into the matter!!😆😆😂😂
689,Best
690,Just but the iphone 4s. Really like the phone. Only i just deliver a phn with gift & gift wrap option. Expected more from amazon but no worries phn will work fine.Thanks
691,No good
692,"Wanted to purchase Iphone 4S am confused after reading so many Negative feedbacks, the issue been raised by customers is that handsets sold here are used/refurbished with pre-existing issues.Any way to confirm if Iphones sold here are Genuinely New and not refurbished ones.Once confirmed I'll make up mind for purchase. Thanks"
693,Very disappointed. ...want my money backI bought apple 4s but it was tempered....totally dead......fraud people.....will send legal notice
694,I am very sorry to inform you that I met a very bad experience in doing shopping with you. First of all the courier company didn't deliver the package to me on time. The gadget kept lying with the local courier people for three days. They didn't even think of informing me. Secondly the phone camera didn't work at the timing of opening of parcel. Now I am in a contact  with apple people for replacing or repair of my gadget. See the irony all my charm of getting new phn has gone. Thanks for great experience.
695,awesome...
696,i wish good.
697,It's awesome to use I phone 4's it's application is good
698,"I was too too excited to open the sealed box of Apple 4S. but when I turned it on, all my excitement turned into agony when I saw vertical lines showing on the screen all the time. I rushed from one service center to another and have given it for replacement.Mind it- only the handset  will be replaced not the boxes. the sr number on the bill and the box will be different from that of the handset.very depressed"
699,unable to buy is buy button is not working
700,Super offer
701,Not good mobile
702,GOOD
703,good
704,Excellent
705,Is it cdma also
706,"May be it's time to stop low class iphones manufacturing. Apple pushing new OS updates just like it's still supporting older devices. But those updates are heavy, and older devices feels heavy when updated. No matter how much space phone have. Still performance lags. Faced few software issues and iTunes issues. Hard to find solutions. Finally it made me to factory reset my phone."
707,"Posting this review after several years when I sold the phone in 2016 April for 4,500 Rs to dealer for a discount on new model 6S.During all  these years, iPhone 4S served well and it was first used by me for  year, then given to my wife and then to my sister!Unlike many who say warranty is not applicable if bought online. Well Apple warranty starts from Sale date. It was showing correctly the date of purchase and validity on Apple Support Site."
708,"Delivered on the same day as I expected.Do i even need to say about the phone? It's an iPhone.Gifted it to my dad, who apparently doesn't need a phone that has does all crazy stuff, just talking, messages and photos; he loves using it.Fits my bill. Price did not drop as I expected. It was only an 8 GB variant, so taking away a star."
709,"Its was gift for my husband and am happy he loved the product. Apple no other brand can beat this on quality and performance.Amazon delivery was just next day, so that was really good. Am happy to buy product with Aamzon and found their service Super Excellent.Geeta"
710,"A good Apple product. You know the difference when you hold Apple in one hand and Samsung in another. Samsung Android product would have many features and useful applications at a lower price, but the look and feel of an iPhone is a different experience altogether."
711,"very useful, doesnt let me feel its old at all... Good for accessing office email, chat application other than personal...basically a small, handy, not so flashy, yet fast adapting OS 8 makes it easier to cope up with present applications"
712,APPLE PHONE IS SHOWING PROBLEM WITHIN 10 DAYS OF USE I HAVE GIFTED IT TO MY SISTER ON HER MARRIAGE BUT NOW SHE IS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PERFORMANCE.WHETHER THE PRODUCT IS GENUINE OR NOT I AM NOT SURE.NOW I' VE TO TAKE IT TO APPLE STORE FOR SERVICE AS PER CUSTOMER SERVICE ADVICE OF AMAZON
713,Worth the price
714,Good
715,"Worth buying, its awesome"
716,A very nice product in its class.Excellent sound quality. Camera is very nice. Product Finish is elegant.NB:Amazon always provides original piece if bought from Amazon Fulfilled seller.
717,good price
718,Good priduct
719,After using it for one year am reviewing it so that people having the myth of online product should go off. It's perfectly working fine and no issues till now.
720,"Genuine Seller, no issues at all.Just want to share that the Internet keep losing the connection and that's irritating, i use 3G Idea, don't know if its manufacturing issue or BAU facing issues for all Apple users."
721,"not bad...for the money I paid...just an another Iphone...gets stuck or we can say ""hang""...for what you spend you get the same...itunes a big liability...cannot do things what we can do with an another phone...my next phone definitely not an Iphone..."
722,It fits in your palm. Extremely good display screen and fonts. Satisfaction reached to its max once started using it. Genuine product from Apple on Amazon
723,good
724,"Fast delivery and it works well , also got it at lowest price. Actually it was purchased for my friend . Now I am searching iPhone 5s for another friend who is waiting for price down. Thanks Amazone India"
725,Nice product and prompt delivery. No issues and using almost for 2 years now.
726,"Very good delivery and also the mobile was awesome......""If it is not an IPhone, then it is not an IPhone"""
727,Apple quality is known to every body. But the battery life is horribly poor. Lasts for less than a day even for normal use.have to charge twice a day. Mobile charger sales will pick up. By the way I am an apple fan.
728,Costly phone
729,all good but only problem with apple is no extendable memory and their each software update itself is for 1 gb
730,"Best in its class....Apple,the brand's name tells it all"
731,Good product at a good price.

736,"Received phone in excellent condition, in original sealed packing. Checked online and the phone is genuine with warranty by Apple India. Great value for money."
737,"Apple is Apple wonderful device no second thought , but since its 8 GB just Space issue , i suggest if your using more the space will not support you , hence go for bigger one."
738,3 years still performing well
739,I purchased it few months back & totally satisfied with item received.Thank you.
740,sorry apple  or amazon .... the phone is not working properly.....
741,very bad.do not loss ur money.
742,Great to use! Good functionalities at a decent price. Will look at upgrading in a year
743,"Almost every details are good.But, tends to be slow after the IO8 update."
744,"Ooh. I purchased 4S but i never know that the network issue in Iphone 4s is very big problem, When you calling hanging and heating issue . Very disapponted"
745,"In Start Product looked nice but now after 2 months charger not working , Battery life is another problem. Camera is good."
746,Good One but need latest one.
747,A perfect phone for anybody who's looking for a device which manages everything and anything with a software so user friendly you cannot resent it.
748,Thanks for the product. but facing some software issues in the product but it can be handled using apple services.

860,"Apple iPhone 4S (White, 8GB) is a nice phone from apple. It is also an affordable phone for the beginners with affordable cost."
861,good one
862,this is good instrument for rough tough use. i liked this phone.
863,Good
864,This is the best phone ever created by mankind. Package was crisp. I reccomend it although pne woth 16 or 32 gb. Bpught this on EMI. SAFE?OFCOURSE!
865,Do i need to write a review. Every one knows i phone z incredible. Awesome.
866,Nice Phone but little bit hot after using
867,Satisfied with the product
868,Product is good !!
869,nice product.
870,PHONE GOOD. BATTERY BACK UP VERY POOR.
871,"Good feel and build quality, but I had heating issue while charging for 30 mins odd and this heating issue also persisted while speaking for about 20-25 mins, which was bad. Also, if you keep 3G on 24*7, it has lot of battery drain. I had this issue and had to carry the cable to office and charge it very often. So, I decided to return the phone back. This was my first Apple product :-( Hope this issue is rectified in 5c and 5s ?"
872,k
873,"Pros: Nice phone overall,smooth interface,build quality is premium, excellent camera, high res screen, compact size, hardly any other phone is available in this size in this segment.Cons: Very limited space - if you use many apps you may find space available to be a problem. Only 3 GB is available to the user. One solution is that you use icloud storage for pics and videos. Laggy at times - specially whatsapp is particularly slow. Other apps run smooth. Glass front and back can shatter easily - so covers are must. Low battery backup - you will need to charge twice a day. Screen size is small for videos.Overall: Nice if you are not into gaming, many apps and videos. For people who want premium quality in budget price with some compromises."
874,"The best smart phone ever...Ithas only 1ghz procrssor and 512mb ram but it works as fast as 3gb ram and 2ghz multicore processor....,,The only disadvatage is it gets heats up very fast this is due continuous working of hardware for smooth user interface.... I prefer ios rather than an android phone....since iphone is famous for its unhackable os and it provides high security for the user....."
875,"Excellent phone for all purposes. Camera quality is far better than latest smartphones of other companies. Shutter speed is too quick for taking perfect shots. Photo quality is little bad in low light (expected from any smartphone). Little difficult while surfing on net due to low screen size.Overall, still best phone compared to any HTC, Sony, Samsung and Motorola phones.Do not use this phone with any bumper or case, to enjoy its steel-cased beauty."
876,"I bought this mobile on October 10 2014.After 7 months the phone works well.Manufacturing cost of iPhone 4s 16gb is 12000 and add some more bucks for OS,TRANAPORATION& licensing .its value for money.i am using iOS 7 for this 4s 8gb .its really good.go for this mobile for first time apple products in cheap price & nice specification.GOOD OS ,GOOD DESIGN,GOOD CAMERA,GOOD PERFORMANCE,GOOD PRODUCT @ GOOD PRICE #14000#"
877,"I received my I phone,  in very good packing, phone is brand new, nothing any scratches,  I don't know way some people say iphone has heating problem ofcourse its heat when you charged it, every phone is heat, after 20 minutes continue using, or charging.Well I'm fully satisfied,  with packing,  and product.Spacialy in this price ( I can buy it only 13,400)So go for it,  it's better than others)"
878,"Good Phone,I mean AWESOME. Should have been 4 stars .Cons-BatteryBut since I am a #appleGeek couldn't really help it. :D"
879,Guys don't buy this by seeing tempting price...all these phones are either used or defected
880,Good Phone But After iOS 9 It Hanging Every Time....
881,nice phone
882,AWESOME
883,"fro these reviews i found that it is better to buy from showroom :) thank god i saved , i was about to buy :) lol"
884,RAM IS VERY LESS IN COMPARISON TO 2GB RAM
885,"The phone hangs a lot, starting with the screen unlock function. came with a lot of smudges. would not call it a sealed pack. otherwise okay."
886,"Got it not knowing much about apple, was a good buy and apple experience. Here is the experience, apple is big on planned obsolescence maybe that is why I got it for $55, it is plenty fast and was selling new about 5 years ago, it is stuck on ios 9 while a lot of the apps you want are ios 10 in the store (travel, parking, etc) though most games are OK so far. You know there are ios 9 apps in the store but they don't offer them with a warning, you just have to use safari for apps like kayak or expedia, at the price I paid it didn't take much soap to wash the bad taste out of my mouth on my first apple purchase."
887,"I was never able to use this phone because the provider never fully unlocked his phone from his ATT provider. I tried three avenues to resolve this issue.  Issue never resolved. I had spent my last bit of cash on this item and went without a working phone for over a month, as a result.  I never recovered favorably from this hardship"
888,"It was supposed to be unlocked however I put in my tmobile sim card and tried ti activate it on my account with the help from t mobile and we could not get the phone to work at all.  They even tried with a brand new SIM card and it stl wouldn't work.  They said that it couldn't be used on t mobile, so I ended up paying to ship it back and I'm still looking for a decent replacement phone for my current one."
889,"I was able to not give this item/seller any star, I would do it. My phone stopped working after two months after I start using it!!... Since it was not covered any more under amazon 30 day return policy, I contacted the seller but they never answered my emails. I called apple customer service for my one year warranty, I made an appointment with apple store and provided them with phone serial number. I was shocked when they said that the serial number on the outside is different from the one inside the phone, and the original serial number was for a different phone (a black phone, non GSM, with 32GB)!! even though I bought it as described (unlocked GSM 8GB). which means this is FRAUDULENT PHONE!!"

909,"Just as described, brand new ready to be activated at my local AT&T store, no problems, up and running perfectly."

It really rocks because it came out of innovation and it is from Apple..READ MORE

For everyday things like watching YouTube, checking Facebook and so on it should be fine. 
 
Regarding iOS, the newest version available is iOS 9.3.5, which isn't too old, but since it's not updatable to iOS 10 and above, you should look for another one if you want to have the latest and greatest software. 
 
It will cover basic usage just fine though, as long as you are patient and give the phone a little more time to switch apps. Lags won't be a thing to worry about though, except I you only put trash on your phone and use it like a brand new iPhone 7"

Don't use the Facebook, Twitter apps if you can help it. If you are using these apps, don't update them anymore through iTunes. I use the web browser for these. Simple fix for me.

I still use my 4s as my daily phone. You have to understand that this phone is 5yrs old. It's still a solid phone. The issue comes from these apps being updated which require more and heavier power resources. The 4s was designed when apps had a lighter power use. Not to mention that the updates don't always show a visible benefit to us users."

I wonder what they going to reveal which they will say they are the first again..hmmmm...maybe widget, and come the guy will say iPhone 5 is the first phone to have true widget...hahaha..so funny"

An S apparently, lol, I love my iPhone 4 and it would have to take a radical change in handset design and usability for me to ""upgrade"" but a faster processor and an upgraded camera (which I don't need as my 5 megapixel iPhone 4 camera is the best I've seen on a handset) is not worth me paying money to upgrade, looks like im sticking with what I have for now until the iPhone 5 or 6!!"
350,it s old tech. More powerfull mobile have in market. Now its toy.
351,"Oh boy, im seriously dissapointed here. I put off upgrading my phone because I waited for the next iphone. What does apple give us? The same phone with just a updated camera and processor.  
 
The overall design is exactly the same and should cost much less now since its over a year old, but apple will still charge an arm or a leg for it. 
 
I mean there was not even a change to their ipod range, I did not even hear about the new ipad. 
 
I was really hoping for a bigger screen at least. Looks like I am gonna go with the galaxy S2. No use upgrading from my iphone 4 to this...There isnt much incentive with the 4s to upgrade at all."
352,what no iphone 5 i was hoping for it apple disappoint  me and many other people when will ip5 come out .
353,"Does it have flash player?  
They have done it again. 'One little step for Samsung a giant leap for Apple' Apple always take little step at a time. It's a money making scam."
354,"the difference between iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S are processor,camera and a lot of utility features (ex: sIri which lets you use your voice to send messages, schedule meetings, place phone calls, and more. Ask Siri to do things just by talking the way you talk. Siri understands what you say, knows what you mean, and even talks back. Siri is so easy to use and does so much, you’ll keep finding more and more ways to use it)"
355,"Bluetooth v4, what the hell? Never heard of this, it's not just marketing, meaning it's bluetooth v3 + HS ...?"
356,"hey guys, does it even have a 1 GB RAM or what ? and is it really necessary ?? any help i'll be grateful , because i'm thinking of buying it, any ideas or advice ?"
357,it s old tech. More powerfull mobile have in market. Now its toy.
358,"I will wait for the iPhone 5 next year !  This design is twelve months old now !  
 
"
359,"got disappointment.....after so much wait 
"
360,"it sounds like  
when 3g came aftr that 3GS came   now 4 aftr  
4s "
361,"haha this is it? Well my mind is made up, off to HTC I go! Sensation XE Here I Come!"
362,Apple I think u have made a mistake by keeping name 4S.. people were expecting number 5.
363,"shayan, 04 Oct 2011
what's the difference between this and Iphone 4?
internal hardware improvements. (better camera, processer, etc.)"
364,"this is a joke,what!, are too many android phones getting under apple's skin? this is an act of desperation. I expect nothing less for a money hungry corporation like apple. "
365,what about the ram ?
366,"What a yawn!! 
All that Apple's done with this iphone 4s is catch up in part to Samsung, Htc and Motorola's high end handsets. 
Further, 
I imagine this Apple iphone 4s handset would pose no threat to Samsung's incoming Galaxy Note and Salaxy s2 HD LTE smartphones. 
"
367,"Greatest joke, apple. Well done."
368,"thats a joke .. after all that waiting apple brings a phone twice as much as expensive than the Galaxy s 2 but nothing more than the galaxy s 2 !! 
 
iphone 4s is a joke"
369,"[deleted post]
there is nothing to compare. compare for what? just for camera,memory,CPU & GPU. they r just fooling d people. they took more then 1 1/2 year just to make ds changes. they can do much better then ds if they want. i am not againts iphone but they disappoint everyone. was waiting egarly for ds day but in vain."
370,"Pretty disappointed, I thought Apple was really going to take it out the ball park, Specs pretty much average even less outstanting than other smartphones, truth of the matter, so far the king's still Samsung Galaxy S II!!!"
371,"shayan, 04 Oct 2011what's the difference between this and Iphone 4?Hi dear, 
 
The difference basically is a new and enhanced Iphone 4.  Updates on camera resolution, from 5mpx to 8mpx.  A new dual core A5 processor, ( they didn´t say anything about the RAM in the conference ).  iCloud, to share instantly content with other devices through wireless networks, SIRI ( voice commands to the iphone4S ), and some other applications.  
 
I suggest you to look at the technical specifications of both, iphone4 and iphone4S, here in this webpage to have a better and more accurate idea. 
 
Regards, 
"
372,The main question is who is going to buy this phone now. 
373,is that really it?hahaha i thought they would come up with something creative and new...microsoft+nokia fanboys should be already celebrating lol
374,"shayan, 04 Oct 2011
what's the difference between this and Iphone 4?
the difference is, this one has a dual core chip, ios5, 8mp camera that shoots in 1080p HD, Thats pretty much it. Its not even 4g :("
375,this will chick out samsung galaxy s2 from the play
376,I am sooooo not happy with it!! iv been waiting foor aages and it looks exactly lyk the iphone4 =@
377,What a letdown..Apple trying to milk it again. time to buy a Galaxy S 2.
378,"apple policy= 
Iphone> i3g> i3gs> 4g> 4gs 
Just put an s letter, and there is no change in style, softwhr, interface, designe, same screen size, resulation and release an new phone and makes the people fool and get money"
379,"I think this upgrade of Iphone 4S looks very tiny as compared to Galaxy S2, HTC sensation XE and other phones, which have arrived a lot earlier than this bulshit piece of mobile. Please read all specifications before you buy it. Current market of phones cannot absorb this phone with only 1GB dual core processor chip. Apple shame on you. I am now waiting for Iphone 5 to come which may have 3.7 inches or large display."
380,"The iPhone 4S runs on the same A5 processor that powers the iPad 2 and has an improved camera. It offers 8-megapixels, compared with the iPhone 4's 5-megapixels and, Apple says, will deliver sharper pictures with better colours. 
 
The new iPhone also has improved wireless performance, which Apple says allows it to switch between cellphone towers, during a call, to ensure the best quality. The iPhone 4S also has faster data upload and download times.  
 
The best feature of the new iPhone is Siri, a voice-activated assistant, brings voice control to the iPhone 4S. Basically, you ask Siri questions out loud in plain english, and Siri makes sense of what you’re asking and presents you with results and actions. Siri launches with a long press of the home button, just like Voice Control of yore, but after that the options are fairly endless. “Do I have a meeting Friday at noon?” Siri checks the calendar and responds out loud. “What time is it in Paris?” Siri shows you a world clock. “Set my alarm for…” you get the idea. The verbal response of Siri allows it to clarify if it understands what you’re saying, and in turn perform some pretty complicated actions, like setting up a meeting with Phil Schiller for Friday at noon. Like with the original version of the app, Siri remembers the context of what you’ve been asking, so actions can build on each other. You can also ask Siri to look things up on Wikipedia for you, and Siri can use Wolfram Alpha to do more complicated calculations. Siri’s list of capabilities is near endless, including asking it to play genres of music for you, look up something on maps, or what the weather is. Our favorite question? “Siri, who are you?” Siri responds: “I am your humble personal assistant.” 
 
The iPhone 4S will run Apple's new iOS 5 operating system, which will be released on October 12. iOS 5, which includes a new iMessage messaging system, improved notifications and a Newsstand app for newspapers and magazines"
381,"AnonD-22512, 04 Oct 2011Nothing new !! Only IOS5 this is only an update!!A5 dual-core processor, 8MP F2.4 lens, 1080P recordings

There are no pixels density inprovements, what are you talking about?, it is just an iphone 4 with a dual core processor and bigger lens, iphone 4 already worked very well with a single core processor, you wont notice major improvements in a phone that cant even run emulators...."
384,"seriously the iphone 4s is a FAILURE..i love apple,but we waited for so long ...for this?? theres nothing special on it.HTC is muuuch better equiped than this...and seriously guys,it looks EXCACLY THE SAME with the previous one...little changes.nothing special on it..i call it FAIL!so dissapointed"
385,oooh come on!!!! is this a joke!!! apple took  1 and half year just for this !!!! Really really disappointed apple ..........
386,how about RAM Memory ??? 
387,"ok , i can say it now : "" Apple's Days have finished"" , it's time for Samsung And HTC and SOny ericsson to Lead the Groupe ............... in means : "" Android For The Best"" .............. and let's don't forget about Bell OS from Nokia."
388,What new iPhone?
389,"Siri is cool but many of its function were available on old nokia phones like message reader, sound order and so on.it s just improved in a good way but its not so much wondering and a reason to buy this fucky phone with its old old design and hardware that used months before in android devices.i think i phone will lose users to android. Dont u think?  I get so disappointed"
390,i like u NOKIA ...
391,"The difference between the 4 and the 4s is that the 4s is equipped with a 1ghz dual processor, the cam can take full hd videos, the storage capacity have received a new member the 64 Gb, the pixels density has improved and finally the phone is boosted by a 1gb ram which makes them far from being twins :P"
392,"I am very very disapppointed in the recent Apple's release of their new iphone. The Iphone 4S could and would have made a mark if they weren't aping the current iphone 4..  
 
My lord, at times like this, How I wish Steve Jobs would have never step down from his position. He would have made a drastic change to this oh so boring iphone 4S

398,"You're right mate! 
The Apple Iphone 4s is no threat,

403,One of the best phone ever. All iphones are good with flawless design flawless software & applications. Buy blindly. One iphone users may not willing to buy any other branded phones this is sure once iphone is us to it.
404,"Hello. 
I just wanted to mention, that the (actually hated) camera user interface of the iPhones have a secret advantage. No, it is not something, that everybody already knows about it (absolute zero shutter lag + high, flawless speed, unlimited burst shots and using rectangles instead of circles and squares for face detection) 
It is the way, AF/AE-lock works. In that area, Apple's camera user interface is fairly superior. 
AE can even be compensated, during AF/AE lock is active. I am talking about the auto-mode, which is the only photography  (scenery) mode actually, which is suitable for taking photos. There is also a square-mode, but that one has only one purpose: removing 408 pixels from each horizontal side of the photo.  
 
Another hidden advantage, which is actually the main advantage, is, that the range of the exposure compensation is ±~5 EV (exposure value), as far as I can guess. Much wider than Samsung's compensation in auto mode, which was introduced in S6 edge Plus and Note 5, but S6 and S6 Edge will get them with the Marshmallow update. 
But the Marshmallow update will also bring Camera has been opened via Quick Launch. That's an ugly error message, which causes the camera-application to close after five seconds, if you fail to hit that little OK-button.. 
Something, which is really one of my favourite features on real cameras, and probably better than HDR, because it includes proper EXiF-information, are bracket shots. 
 
AF= autofocus 
AE= automatical exposure"

412,"What is the temperature at which the Temperature Alert is displayed? 
 
Apple an American multinational technology Company, has, for the past 72 days, been refusing to accept the evidence of an overheating new replacement iPhone that I had purchased and returned to the service center on the same day. Apple claims it does not have any instrument to measure the temperature of the iPhone on complaints regarding overheating. I had to take a thermometer to the Apple Service Center and in the presence of the Apple Service Center executive I had recorded a temperature of 108 deg F within minutes in a video recording, a temperature which makes it impossible for a person to place the iphone over the ear. Apple refuses to acknowledge this evidence. In addition, Apple support team over chat informed me that upon replacement of  iPhone, they do not have the month/year of manufacture of the IMEI of the iPhone and also it does not come with a box in which product details are printed. I seem to have been given a refurbished phone without my knowledge. Any advice on it? 
 
Apple says Apple Diagnostic Tests clear your iPhone as ""Safe to Use"" and in addition the temperature alert is not triggered? I wanted to know the cutoff temperature at which the Apple temperature alert is triggered. Apple says this information is Private and Confidential to Apple. Does this make sense? Is Apple really the world leaders of phones as they claim. What about a social/ moral responsibility that such companies have towards its customers?"

As far as I could know that the 4s devices which are upgraded to iOS 9 (even the brand new products which comes with pre-installed iOS 9) having the issues with battery- draining too fastly and heating while charging and sometimes using internet, lagged response and hanging issues- some devices facing issues like , while call coming the display took more time than it's supposed to be to wake up, which results unable to attend the call.  
Even after giving the feedback through beta program the company doesn't care to fix the issues. I they may also rectify or even understand the issues properly. Maybe that's the reason they were forced to slash the price for 4s. In one way they are trying to lure out the customers with this price slashing and thus to sell out all those crapy devices which are already in their stock."

I see some people saying that the IPhone 4s is now useless in 2016 but I don't have any issues with it. It is fast, although it does lag a little bit in the IOS 9. If you want to increase the performance you can turn off the ""Hey Siri"" and the spotlight search. I had the IPhone 4s for quite a while now and it is still a great phone. It is very cheap now days, so I would recommend you getting it. Although it doesn't have the night shift, and some other IOS 9 features it is still a good phone."

You wont regret it pal. My first iPhone was the 4s, and I really liked it. I eventually upgraded to iPhone 5s and to this day it is one fast smooth phone. Battery life is decent but I am not on it as much. The 5s is perfet and trust me it will feel better in your hand than the 4s"

I am going from iOS7 to iOS9 as i type so we will see on that. first attempt failed but thats because i ran out space, was at the limit to begin with plus was syncing it up changing music at the same time. anyhow it has held up great. I had a case for 6 months and took that off. Most of all i love the size and feel of this phone naked. I have not had any issues with it being naked even with my job being outside in all elements climbing and crawling in all sorts of nasty stuff, but i am mindful of it. I am coming due for an upgrade and i think i will get the 5s because i think the 6 is to big imo."

I was happy with my iPhone 3, it lasted several years before having any issues.  Sadly, the same cannot be said for the 4S.

If you are satistisfied of its screen size  then there will be no pronlem. Just  grab with a higher memory as most apps keeps on updating and it takes more memory of the phone. So 32 and 64 is much better. I have 16 gig and  have multiple apps open simultaeneously in multi tastking although sometimes it lags but not an issue at all. Security features are great. I recommend this phone for those have a smaller."

My i4s indicates I need a passcode. Where can I find one? I have never had one.
Passcode is a security of your phone. It would ask you to enter a passcode if you have already created one. Every time you lock the phone it will ask you you to enter the passcode after you slide to unlock. Passcode will not ask if u have turned off this feature. If you do not know the passcode maybe the phone is not yours."

I second this. Was not a fan of Android for that exact reason. My first android was in 2010 a Motorola Droid, over the course of one year it became very laggy and rough, and it was very bad at simply sliding in between homescreens. It aged horridly. In 2013 I tried my luck again, this time with a smoother LG Optimus F7, great machine but by 2014 it had aged bad. I really liked the LG OF7!! The iPhone 4S on iOS9, while not as fast, it can still hang!! I find that Blackberry and iPhones have insane durability!! Great little machine the 4S is"

Battery is draining quickly, sometimes in front of my eyes when I'm using my phone. But I have a solution for the lag problem. First open your settings >general >Accessibility >increase Contrast> reduce transparency (switch it on). 
 
Second, in same settings open accessibility and head to Reduce Motion and switch it on as well. 
 
There you go no more lag on iOS 8 or 9.

I'm currently using an iPhone 4s 8GB and I must say, I really love it! I've been using it for 6 months. Though the memory quite bothers me as it gets low when taking so much photos, what I do is I back up it all up on my computer at the end of the day to free up space. The battery life is good, lasts 7 hours, for emails, texting, social networking, taking photos and music. The phone heats up, mostly when data is on or when charging. I chose the 4S because of its size, 3.5"" screen is good for me though the 5S is great but there's not much difference between the two. Overall, the phone is great, really worth it."

Hey bud, I use iPhone 5S for work, accounts, finance, music, social media, streaming, movies, and TV episodes. To me it works fine. The apps run smooth on the 5S. This is my commanding phone. My second in command phone is Blackberry Classic. It runs mainly my school work, emails and messaging and I love it how I can get homework done on it plus it rocks a sweet keyboard. For back up, fun, and testing, I have the iPad Mini 2 128GB, LG G4, HTC M9, Blackberry Z30, Blackberry Z10, and Samsung Galaxy S6. I can tell you, while I do not have the iPhone 6, the 5S is perfect for me as my main phone. While small, I do use it to connect to the TV using an HDMI cable so that I can stream video, watch episodes and movies, and my music is all in one place. After Blackberry decided to shut down its media department, I was forced to solely use iTunes for media. I used to be able to buy TV episodes, music and movies and play them on TV via HDMI cable as well."

I use an iPhone 4S as a company device, iPhone 6 for testing and Galaxy Note 3 personally. Have to say, iPhones are restrictive, break too easy (physically and the software excluding core iOS feature), terrible, terrible battery life, mediocre screen at best, iPhone 4S too small to type fast on, no swype, regular carrier and roaming issues in the UK between 4S and 6 (Android you can just edit the APN settings if a problem arises, locked down by carriers on iOS), the bespoke iPhone cables and earbuds need to be replaced yearly, some of our company users need them replaced up to every 3 months and finally, you need a Mac, running OSX 10.10 just to apply configuration profiles to devices in an MDM environment. Bad Bad Bad! Windows support was dropped in iOS 6 - When contacted, all Apple could really tell us was ""Well, why wouldnt you want a Mac?"". Because they don't work in a windows enterprise environment that uses any sort of certificate token authentication for domain access, that's why! Besides, out of principal you shouldn't be forced into buying Apple hardware just to make existing Apple hardware work again (as it did when originally purchased), That's poor show!

Oh and Apple, and innovation, together .. Thats pure marketing spin unless buying established technologies from other companies is innovation!"

Factory restore your device by turning it off, then holding down the home button whilst plugging it into computer with iTunes running (keep the home button held). This puts it into recovery mode. Then format the device using iTunes. 
 
NOTE** After reformatting the device, if it is registered to an iCloud account (most are) the device will need to be unlocked by entering your iCloud email and password - So if you have stolen the device.. you cannot reset it, it's useless, dont bother just hand it into the police."

Again trust me, the usage these days 16GB device is not enough. Pictures videos and music fills up, messages will cause you to fill up, and apps will cause it to full up and fast. I really recommend at least get a 32GB model. iOS updates are big files usually taht do take up storage. And yes always update the phone only gets better with updates. The software demands a lot and the 4S hardware will try to keep up. If you can I recommend a 32GB 5s instead. It is just WAY better and smoother. It is one powerful small little phone"

1297,"BEST PHONE EVER!!!! 
Some people's opinions say that the phone is quite rackity because of the battery drainage.  
I highly doubt that. As long as you slide the dot to the lowest brightness and start listening to music 24/7, you're good to go and experience no problems what so ever.  
I use this phone as my personal ""second"" ipod player (thanks to the idownloader app by Andy Zhang) record videos for my Youtube channel, read a lot of my fanfiction PDF's on I-Books and snap photos for my website and personal File Explorer use.  
Games run fine, experienced no problems with this phone.  
No automatic shut downs on me (except for that one time I ran the Safari app and it hated that.) and the battery life is AMAZING!!!! 
Charge it FULL in the morning, 45 minutes later in the evening you see it FULL charge.  
The secret? Low brightness 24/7.  
Although, I very soon wish to own another phone (Iphone 6 plus, Galaxy, or IOcean X7), I'm still keeping this awesome phone as a second music player.  
Even though powering it on (booting up) might be very SLOW, I would still recommend this phone! :D"

Go to Settings and do a Security Wipe/Factory Reset. It will delete ALL your files so make sure you find a way to back up your music, photos, and videos.

Really beleive me i sold my 4s just bcz it was so laggy on 8.3 
And i only installed whats app,fb,messanger,tr2
If you run it on ios7 its workd well
But on 8.3 it is a piece of shit 
Dont update it on 8.3 you will not happy wid ur decision
And also after updating on 8.3 it gives you around 5+ gb of usage my opinion is 1000% true "

1394,"This was my first iPhone and I loved it. Prior to this I had, an LG Viewty, LG Renoir, LG Arena, Blackberry Curve and the Blackberry Torch. In May 2012 I was convinced to get this machine, and I loved it. Music player was superb camera was pretty great and it was 8MP, also Email was pretty decent (the iPhone 4 did not have Push notifications). Many media features, and personally i Like buying media from App Store. A few minor disadvantages here and there, but overall it feels complete. The glass body on the back was cracked to pieces but it still works flawlessly to this day. I found that while multitasking and messaging is easy, Blackberry handles both way better. Overall I was very satisfied and was very happy with my iPhone 4S. I had it from May 2012 until late 2013 when I got the Blackberry Z10, and as of January 2015 I now use the iPhone 5S. Love Apple and Blackberry."

1397,"Iam using i phone 4s for past 3 months. It is a better phone i have ever used with awesome technology.  
The main dis-advantanges are: Its battery. If u switch on 3G then the battery keeps draining and become empty within 3 to 4 hrs. Most importantly all other phones are competing with this technology and i think 4s is out of date. If you are buying 8 or 16 GB then you have think twice or thrice to install a new app."

Cannot recommend 8GB version at all you will be wasting your money and Apple should not be selling 5c with this memory either. I think you will be down to 4.5gb out of the box,then add some apps get your contacts on etc and you will be out of storage. If you use this phone for talk and text it will work but if you are spending your money these days on a phone,,ANY smartphone 32GB is minimum,,even 16GB Androids are struggling with all updates on board it is not worth it."

1543,It is a great phone to use. I like how it is wider than the iphone 5c for typing. I have it on the latest update. I use it as a work phone when I do not want to use my 6 plus. I have a lifeproof for it when I am going fishing. I usally use a cheap flip case for it when I am at work. It does have lag when comparing it to the 6 plus. When the 6S comes out I may end up getting another 5C but a 32GB verison. I gave my old 5C 16GB to my Dad for his birthday this year when I upgraded to the 6 plus.

I suggest not to buy this phone because of the low RAM amount - 512 MB. You WILL experience lags. And there's a good chance that you will not get the next major iOS 9 update. 
 
If you want to purchase an iPhone, I recommend iPhone 5 and up. They have bigger amount of RAM making them more future-proof. "

I have had them all but just feel iPhone 4s superb device but folk who want bigger and better will choose newer models. Never used touch ID past a few days but 5s and 6 being able to take loads of photos in a few seconds is superb. I remember 2005 shutter lag in cameras now iPhone 5s/6 doing 20 photos,in focus in a few seconds.

I should say i am one of those persons that like smaller, phone sized phones."

Yes but half the length is bezel, 5s looks much better in that regard. And 5s is much slimmer and longer to avoid the Old Brick feel many get from 4s.  
And how about wide video? They look awful small on 4s.  
Performance, 5s is insanely powerful. 
Battery, screen on time of 5s is nearly the double. 
TouchID is unspeakable good. 
Lightning port is great. 
Camera of 5s many notches above 4s. 
 
I will still recommend 4s, very capable phone but those who can afford 5s must not even think of 4s."

Apple's 5, 5c and 5s screens look inappropriately taller and it is uncomfortable to watch videos or movies or even while reading in landscape mode. 
 
4s is still the best iphone and does not feel slower even though there are so many advanced smartphones are available in the market. But if you are comparing with iphone 5s then it is certainly slower. I'm still using 4s and it has not yet disappointed me. 
 
Battery life of 4s is suffered a lot after ios 8.1.3 and it drains fast. See my suggestions below in improving battery life for 4s 
 
In short, do these - 
Switch off location 
Switch off  brightness in auto and keep it in manual mode 
Switch off 3G whenever not required 
Switch off privacy and 3G access to unwanted apps 
 
If you take these steps, I'm sure you will see good improvement in battery life.

1817,"Please scroll down and see my comments. 
 
Switch off location. 
Change brightness from auto to manual. 
Avoid unwanted app to share 3G and location. 
Switch off 3G whenever not required."

I think, fast battery draining issues are with iphone 4s ios 8. You can do the following to minimize fast draining - 
 
1. Turn Location Off by going to Settings > Privacy > Location. Trust me, location eats up your battery power very fast. Similarly, turn off location for unwanted apps as well. 
 
2. Just check the brightness of the phone if it goes full during the daylight. Reduce it. High brightness with 3G on in the daylight sucks baterry power very fast. 
 
3. Chang the auto-lock to 1 min atleast during ideal time. 
 
4. Last but mot the least, pray for good ipdate from Apple on battery backup for iphome 4s 
 
This is such a wonderful phone that stil beats many high end phones in the performance today but lacks in battery life. 
 
Good speed, good camera & flawless software but battery sucks! "

I am planing to buy a new IOS device and I am going to be a first time user of Iphone. I like the design of 4s a lot but it coming with 8gb storage which is a concern area whether it is sufficient and how much space does IOS internally takes. 
 
Secondly 4s still comes with IOS 5??? And whether the updates to IOS 6 orIOS 7 is still there to update or I have to directly move for IOS 8 which is supposed not to be the right move for such a ageing device.

Granted, a good portion of my smart phone experience includes the game Ingress, which is the ultimate battery/processor/overclocker test for any smartphone. Even in keeping two apps open and sitting in my pocket during the course of the day the battery dies rather fast. I go through a morning with light use and still by 2PM my battery is dying after taking it off charge around 8AM.  
I have not been a very big Apple fan my entire life, always drifting to Android and PC.  
But giving this phone an honest review (from a three year IT Tech). 
The build quality is good, it feels strong. BUT i would advise an Otterbox.  
The multitasking is decent, but it overheats consistently and lags frequently. 
The battery sucks. I own two battery packs and usually by the end of the day, they both are drained. 
I would not recommend this phone for anyone, since Apple is outdating the 4S in 2015 you loose whatever minimal customer service your getting."

M still not sure that it's a good decision over Nokia Lumia 730 or not."
2245,"dude, try using battery doctor in your 4s, it will allow you to remove cache in order to increase memory. Also, i recommend that you update your iPhone 4s thru iTunes by recover and just re download all your favorite apps in that way you will see the big difference on updating Ios 8.0.2 on your iPhone 4s.  Eventually a lot of ways on how to minimize battery drain just check online, it will not be as useful as you think but it is also better not to consume all the features if it is not in use."

2270,Apple iPhones have been nothing better than an actual telecommunication device. I worked for iPhone support and the horror stories I had to listen to on a daily basis were far worse than I have read here. If you want an iPhone (because of it's status) use it as a phone otherwise its good for nothing more. Get an android device. You'll pay less and get a better product and you won't be paying for the apple name.

2383,"AnonD-310429, 21 Sep 2014Guys i want to know that iphone 4s is good or nokia lumia or samsung..? please tell me fastThe fact is we get bored of every phone after one or two months but the major thing is that what is going to look classy in ur hands after that. …i have a lumia nd due to the up comming versions of lumia in every one or two month my phone has just got old even when it is not old and as lumia has d platform of windows nd now a days windows come in many brands mobiles like samsung ,lg etc, so every handset just look d same on screen wid just some little screen diffrences , u can get a lumia with windows 8.1 in 10,000 bucks or a windows 8.1 of some other brand in a very low rate so wat is d use of buying a lumia nd secondly nokia dosent provide that much good camera quality nd we all know that.…but when you are buying an apple it is simply apple …it is classy with the looks,great sound after all its apple , it is fast, camera quality is also good nd the bigest advantage it has its own sofware which is not an android or a windows we usually find in all the latest smartphones making it a stand apart from other smartphones, u can keep an iphone for 3 years or more than that still you wont get bored of it  nd you will feel great whenever you will get it out of your pants pocket ,after all we all want to look classy , nd d steel metal band around it with the oleophobic coating on both sides front and back and d famous apple logo…u can make an impression with dat among others but with a lumia  u urself will get bored after a few months ......believe me if you are paying a large sum of money for a smartphone go for apple  rather than lumia......but in a low budget windows is also a good choice as it has many advantages over an android based phone nd the major one is an android phone hangs a lot of times more than a windows and  can only be updated once but a windows phone u can update as much versions as u can with the latest ones which keeps on improving ur software each time …i have been using all the three phones a sony xperia with android, a nokia lumia,and a n apple i phone 4s nd in my view you should go with apple its worth the money..... The only thing you will complain about an iphone 4s is that it the heating issue but it is normal nd which phone doesn't heat up ,some heat up a little nd some more but you will face this problem with a new phone only nd after using 3-4 days  everything will be back to normal...i will suggest you to buy phones from amazon as they give a 30 days replacement gaurantee with a very good service on ur door steps...nd the cost of phones are also very low in compared to others....

It will ask you for the location of the firmware.Select the firmware u have downloaded..Thats it,itunes will do the rest."

2413,"Do not upgrade your iphone 4s yet, i have updated mine and the performance have decrease but still the overall interaction with the phone is smooth but not as smooth as ios 7.1.2 . There had been hiccups and some apps load slower like safari, camera, photos, health app. It would be not advisable to upgrade because there aint so much features added tod our phone, just few tweaks on settings, assistive touch and some built in apps. For me it is not worth the upgrade. You will just ruin your xperience with the phone. Luckily i was able to go back to 7.1.2 , i am not pretty sure if it is still possible so i wont upgrade my phone anymore.  Do not sacrifice your phone's performance for some tweaks that turn out to be irreversible. As i said, performance is smooth, but it suffers with drop of framerate and slower execution of apps. If you dont mind it, it is a great update, it was not like ios 7 on iphone 4. I hope it would get better on the following ios 8 bug fixing update

2516,"AnonD-299222, 28 Aug 2014Why people r writing that it's the best phone when it's not . I have many reasons to say that.... moreyeah you're right about all of them. can't download, mp4 videos only and the obligatory use of itunes. 
those are the downside of IOS, compared to android which can work with drag and drop. 
but performance is great specially on games, 2 year old phone but still can play real boxing without lag or hang. android cannot do that. a 2 year old android would probably cannot play latest games smoothly, like my xperia s which lags playing shadow fight, unplayable nba 2k13, and i think it cannot handle real racing and real boxing. 
my iphone 4s deals with them with ease, 
but of course, every platform has their own disadvantages.

Priya I've been using android for long. Then I changed to iPhone. It is ways better than android in case of smoothness, and battery backup. Developers publish apps in AppStore first. Then only on google play. Abdroid is not worth comparing to iPhone. It's amazing."
2530,"Iphone 4s doesn't lag, and very smooth when navigating the UI, it may suffer very little lag, maybe not noticeable if you won't put much attention to it and still looks smooth afterall, especially when the assistive touch is turned on while transperancy is also on. But most of the time, it runs smoothly with assistive touch turned off, and might not experience any lag. 
i usually don't use assistive touch coz it causes lag in some apps like messaging and appstore, and sometimes on animations and transitions. 
battery backup is depends on your usage, if you're a heavy gamer, then battery will just last for 4-5 hours with 3g activated.  
for normal use, it will last more than one day. 
i love this phone for gaming though some latest games aren't run smoothly, like real racing (which is heavy in terms of graphics), but old games like dead trigger, and others run without lag. 
internet is good, but sometimes 3g usually drop and needs to open safari to reconnect the phone to the internet to use appstore or any 3rd party apps that needs internet. (this happens very rarely) so nothing to worry about. 
overall this is a great phone and it still last for more than a year from now and still remain a great phone. 
if you plan to upgrade, don't go for iphone 5, jumped to either iphone 5s or 6 coz it's the start of new iphone generation with faster chipset (64 bit), coz iphone 5 will suffer what iphone 4 had in terms of os update and hardware gap within it's "

2638,"hey guys . i just want to tell about my experience about this phone IPHONE 4S 
i have been using this phone since 4 month and here's my review 
PROS 
superb camera quality  
awesome display (retina display) is just too good) 
Ios no doubt is the best no lags whatsoever running 7.1.2 flawlessly  
awesomme BUILT quality 
sound quality also good  
CONS  
small screen size(if you dont want a bulky phone and want a good phone 4s is the best) 
battery backup isnt that great in 3G network barely a day but in 2g full day  
 
overall if you dont have a iphone you dont have one  
i am very happy with my phone , i have used a lot of android phones in my life but Iphone is iphone but comparison , at first i never liked iphone because of overprice but now i understand why its price is high , yes they give you value of money . 
so steal it  
yes if you want a big screen phone with a lot cooler features go for HTC desire 816 or if you want a good phone at this segment 4S is the best 
Thank you

1. when 4s is updated its battery charging and discharging information is changed. Sometimes if you restore your 4s they may be calibrated and fix the problem. 
2. Your battery may be drained by one of few apps. Double click the home button and delete active apps or if you identify such apps, re install them. 
3. Your phone has an ios 7 bug.Restore may fix it. 
4. Check your battery charging time. If both are short or quick the problem may be a weak battery and/or wrong calibrations. 
These are the hints according to my knowledge. I am not a technician. Try for them. Happy life.

maybe apps are cashed when RAM is taken by other apps but it makes the phone slower, add more RAM and have true multitasking then this phone will be so AWESOME. 
 
like  you open Dead trigger, then pressed home button and play another game like shadow gun and real racing. 
dead trigger starts over again, shadown gun starts over again, the email you had open will starts over again and it is annoying, even the music player, last viewed on the music player was ""NUMB - Linkin Park"" then still playing and heard next song. after you press home buttn, play some heavyg games then player will just show ""NUMB"" when you open the music player again, so 512mb ram is insufficient to feel the multitasking though it works sometimes

what would you do on an android phone? change fonts, change icons and launcher, then you got lags and freezes and force close because of not sufficient RAM caused by tons of apps installed and running in the background just to make your phone looks good,  
what is the point of buying smartphone if looks is just your basis? 
well, it depends in the user :) if you have much time customising your phone then go for android then if you are serious type of user, maybe iphone is good for ya, you won't waste time searching and installing apps to make it beautiful, coz it is already.

you said you have rooted your live with walkman, changed rom etc. all those customisations are not all available in jailbreak, (i got live with walkman before, and now an iphone 4s) i did what you did with your android phone, at the end of the day, you'll realise it's better to stay with stock and changing rom and tweaks become boring when all of them seem do nothing for the performance, maybe a little like overclocking and applying some tweaks like bravia engine, clear bass and equaliser. 
 
 
If you got bored all of them, you will feel the same with your iphone, so its better to stay in stock os and feel the smoothness it has. at first it is really boriiinnnnnggg. but functionality is the one you need to look when buying smartphone,. (that's why it is smartphone not a toyphone or experimental phone)"

iphone looks good the specs is far behind lumia 1320 
 
ios looks classy and smooth 
 
but windows phone os is also smooth, true multitasking and better hardware. 
maybe apps is far more less than ios apps, but how many apps you'll only use, 5, 6 maybe so the rest of the apps are , i wont say useless but we just don't mind to download. 
 
 
to be honest, iphone 4s is a good phone, i had an android before and i can say is far more superior though so limited with the basics, but that's all you need, email, surf, video, photos, few apps to manage something and customization is not the basis if an os is good, functionality is."
2688,"raja, 14 Jul 2014which is best , htc desire 816 or iphone 4s... pls reply 
go for the iphone 4s, it will last for years, and the performance won't change. (except if the new ios update is not so integrated with this phone, example ios 8. performance may be affected due to hardware limitation. 
buy htc or any android phone, after few months, performance will decrease and starts to have microlag then gets more visible. 
you can turn it back by resetting your phone completely. Most Android BIG COMPANIES like SONY, SAMSUNG, HTC seed their android os update with so many bugs, and sometimes you'll have to wait few months after the new os arrived on nexus devices.

Android is far superior than Apple IOS and holds 85% global share compared with 14% of Apple.  
The iPhone has a lot less features such as no bluetooth data transfer, no SD card support, no Mass storage mode, Google maps is far superior to Apples version, ). iOS only does MP4, MOV and M4V Android supports a lot more including FLASH. IOS has no NFC. Android has the most free apps available. Apple has proprietary hardware if something breaks your paying a lot $$$ for broken cables etc. Voice search with Android Requires a data connection and searches/Text to speech can be done anywhere with reception. iOS Voice search via the Siri requires a Wi-Fi connection. You cant transfer pictures or music to your iPhone without installing itunes. Cant copy files over to your iphone. Email attachments in iOS can only be saved locally if you have an app installed that can handle the file format. 
 
I must give it to Apple for one thing they've done right MARKETING. They sell inferior hardware and features for more $$$ and make people like you believe they're better. LOL go do some research first."

The launch, as many sites are reporting, is due shortly, probably in the first week of October or last week of September. The reasons to opt for this device are simply too many. Just go through the One X's specs and add to it an enhanced battery life, faster processor, and keep in mind the Sense UI of HTC, and I dont think any other smartphone even stands a chance in front of all that. The only hindrance could be if HTC fails to integrate a top notch battery. But only time will tell what they come up with. No harm in waiting for a few weeks though."
2789,The Apple iPhone 4S does not support LTE and also has quite a low power processor for all the things it is expected to be able to do. The choice seems to be  either wait in the hope that the iPhone 5 addresses these points or 'Jump Ship' and go for the Samsung Galaxy S III which has a 1.4GHz Processor and supports LTE but has a slightly lesser quality camera in terms of image quality than the iPhone 4S.  Personally I'm happy to wait for the iPhone 5.

2810,"SAN JOSE, Calif. — This week, nine jurors are expected to hunker down in a federal courthouse here to decide a case that could change how the world’s smartphones and tablet computers look and work. 
  
Reuters 
Samsung's tablet and Apple's iPad are compared in this evidence image presented during the trial between the two companies over patents. 
After nearly a month of testimony in the legal dogfight between Apple and Samsung over patents, the two parties are expected to make their closing arguments on Tuesday. It will then be up to jurors to hash out which Apple patents, if any, Samsung stepped on when it created devices that compete with the iPhone and iPad. Apple is seeking $2.5 billion in damages from Samsung, while Samsung has asked for $422 million in a countersuit against Apple. 
 
But the effects of the case are likely to be felt far beyond these two companies. If Apple prevails, experts believe Samsung and other rivals in the market will have a much stronger incentive to distinguish their smartphone and tablet products with unique features and designs to avoid further legal tangles. 
 
“I think what we’ll see is a diversification of designs in the marketplace if Apple wins,” said Christopher V. Carani, an intellectual property lawyer for McAndrews, Held & Malloy in Chicago."

Apple and his users are not interested in obsolete technology
It isn't obsolete when you lose network signal because you out of range or of course being an iPhone you could just be holding it wrong, and while Android and iPhone owners would both have no signal only us Android users can have live radio to listen to where with iPhone all you have is what's on your limited non expandable memory, and another thing I have is a 32gb memory card in my wallet filled with HD videos along with the 80gb already included on my internal and external memory so I always have extra stuff to watch or just use the memory card for backing up files."

I said before that Google would use the threat of suing Apple to hope it slows down Apple from attacking Android and it's phone manufacturers, but obviously Apple aren't interested in negotiating and just keep on suing away at any opportunity so Google is gonna hit them with all their patent infringements now because the iPhone 5 is coming soon and will most likely have a fair few they need to remove or pay for, or just like what Apple is trying to do to S3 they might have to ban it from sale, so I cannot wait to see the results of this and whether Apple ends up dropping the case against Samsung as part of an agreement because people say 1 of the reasons Google bought Motorola was to defend the phone manufacturers against Apple's constant attacks."

The only reason iPhone doesn't have a radio is because it would be free to use, and Apple wants to force you to use internet so they and the network can charge you for services, and I admit the S3 does sometimes hang but that's because it has a Hell of a lot more features and capabilities so that means it's harder to make a stable OS, where IOS is just so basic it's easy to make it run well."

With each side developing nuclear weapons(Patents) and using the threat of M.A.D(Mutual Assured Destruction) with all of their patents to stop each other going to court for every tiny little thing, and for almost every tech company that works, but Apple just have no ethics and they'll run over anyone who gets in their way of profit."

I know for a fact most iPhone owners are jealous of a lot of what ICS and Jellybean can do but the Fanboys just refuse to admit it, so if Apple actually does care about giving it's customers the best experience and not just making as much money as possible they will copy some ideas."
3038,"Apple COPIED a lot of ideas for the iPhone from Android: 
 
When Apple introduced its new iOS 5 software last year, it was full of features ripped straight from Android. In case you forgot, we collected them all right here. 
 
Notifications appear at a bar at the top 
 
This is perhaps the most blatant copy. Android notifications have appeared in the top bar of the OS since the beginning. It wasn't until last year that Apple finally added it to the iPhone. 
 
Wireless syncing 
 
Android phones have been able to sync wirelessly with the help of some third-party apps. Apple wouldn't allow such apps in the App Store, so it took until last year for iPhone users to enjoy that feature. 
 
Tabbed browsing 
 
Android Honeycomb for tablets had tabbed browsing when it first launched on Motorola's Xoom tablet. Plus a bunch of other alternative browsers for iPhone or iPad allowed the same thing. Apple finally added tabs to Safari for iPhone last year. 
 
New split keyboard 
 
Android users have been able to customize their keyboard configuration thanks to some clever developers. Now Apple allows for a customized split keyboard on iPad that makes typing in portrait mode a lot easier. 
 
Open apps from the lock screen 
 
Since iOS 5 displays notifications on the lock screen,you can swipe them to unlock the phone directly into the app. This is nothing new for Android users who have HTC phones. HTC's Sense skin will allow you to open your favorite apps directly from the lock screen. 
 
Over the air updates 
 
Almost all Android phones are able to receive software updates over the air without syncing to a computer. Apple used to require you to sync your iPhone to iTunes if wanted its update. iOS 5 is the first version of iOS that allows you to receive software updates over the air."

According to Mr. Webster, copy means something that was reproduced from the original, a clone, an imitation, a carbon copy. Does Samsung phones look exactly like Apple iPhone? IPhone has glass and metal, Samsung has polycarbonate plastic and gorilla glass, iPhone has 3.5"" screen, Samsung has 4.8"" screen. Put them side by side, you have twisted mind if you say they look the same. OS wise? They even look different. The word COPY is deeply rooted in your brain that you might get sick if you don't say it at least once a day.
Ironically, iPhone looks very much a copy of Sony Walkman or LG prada."

""How they managed to obtain that sensitive information is easily the most worrisome aspect of this unfortunate story. By taking advantage of ALARMINGLY RELAXED SECURITY POLICY AT APPLE and Amazon,hackers were able to breach Honan's Twitter,Google,and iCloud accounts. They remotely wiped all content stored on his iPhone,iPad,and MacBook Pro."" 
 
""But what happened to me exposes vital SECURITY FLAWS in several customer service systems,most notably Apple’s and Amazon’s. Apple tech support gave the hackers access to my iCloud account. Amazon tech support gave them the ability to see a piece of information —a partial credit card number —that Apple used to release information. In short,the very four digits that Amazon considers unimportant enough to display in the clear on the web are precisely the same ones that Apple considers secure enough to perform identity verification."" 
 
""It turns out,a billing address and the last four digits of a credit card number are the only two pieces of information anyone needs to get into your iCloud account. Once supplied,Apple will issue a temporary password,and that password grants access to iCloud."""

AllThingsD reports that the ongoing patent and design dispute between Apple and Samsung has yielded yet another interesting piece of evidence, this time in the form of a massive internal Samsung document from 2010 showing 126 different aspects of the company's Galaxy S smartphone that were considered to need improvement. Each shortcoming is displayed with a comparison to how the issue is handled on the iPhone and includes a recommendation that in most cases outlines how Samsung should make the behavior of the Galaxy S more like that of the iPhone.

i've been using my iphone 4s for the last 3 months. its a prety good phone but lacks a lot. 
 
advantages- 
- fast enough 
- touch pad is extremly sensitive 
- very easy to handle and user friendly. 
- excellent display even in sunlight 
- wifi hotspot is superb 
- superb sound clarity 
- data transfer speed is good 
- it never hangs 
 
disadvantage- 
-camera shoots 1080hd but it never gives 30fps but its only 24fps. 
-no settings for camera, have to shoot or capture at the highest resolutiion which consumes  lots of space 
-if an app is free its ad supported else u have to pay 
-for anything and everything thing it needs itunes 
-no document reader, editer 
-no mp3 as ringtone 
- front camera never gives what is promised 
- poor mic, its somewhere inside which capture only very close sound. 
- the price in india starts at 44000 inr and its not at all worthy 
- siri never understands indian english, it understands but does something else not what we say

Eric  Schmit of Google stole IOS mobile... moreIf you are an honest person, then why do you agree of Apple stealing ideas from Sony? 
 
 http://www.muktware.com/4029/apple-stole-iphone-design-sony-patented-it-and-sued-everyone-else  
 
You are talking of a free enterprise, then why does Apple brings everybody in court over ideas it had stolen? 
 
 http://betanews.com/2011/09/24/apple-patent-lawsuits-are-hypocritical/  
 
 I've been fairly critical of Apple's recent patent bullying -- what I call innovation through intimidation/litigation. The Apple Fanclub of bloggers and journalists defend the company's patent and other intellectual property claims as protecting its innovations from copying, particularly by Samsung. But who's copying whom? 
 
As several Betanews commenters recently point out, Apple cofounder, current Chairman and former CEO Steve Jobs admits to the company copying from others. From a mid 1990s interview: ""Picasso had a saying, he said: 'Good artists copy, great artists steal'. We have, you know, always, ah, been shameless about stealing great ideas"". 
 
Jobs proudly proclaims that Apple steals great ideas. Shamelessly. I don't have a problem with that. I don't believe there are any original ideas, anyway, something that is becoming more apparent as social media services connect more people. We take cues from the natural world and the people around us. Innovation is a process not so much of creating something new but taking what we know and applying it in different ways or adapted to new situations. 
 
I remember when Apple introduced Mac laptops with backlit keys, which got rave (and deserved) praise from Mac fans and others. But light in darkness isn't a new concept, nor backlit keys. Look no further than your car's dashboard and radio when the headlights are on. Apple innovated in how it brought that concept to the Mac. But even then, the company worked with technologies already available. It's not like Apple engineers spent hundreds of millions of dollars producing a new light source for lighting laptop keyboards. I'm not trying to diminish Apple invention but look at it from a different viewpoint. 
 
Apple defenders don't see it that way. I hear it so often: ""No one created touchscreen cell phones shaped like iPhone until Apple, then everyone copied"". ""Galaxy Tab looks like iPad 2 -- it's copying, stealing"". But what's wrong with that? The cornerstone of patent law is limited monopoly. The government grants the inventor a limited-time monopoly on the invention in exchange for publishing it. The idea is to spur more invention by way of derivative works, and in a sense that's innovation by copying on the work of others. Society hugely benefits from this approach, as one inventor's creation leads someone else to make something else -- thus pushing technology's advance. Patents are supposed to spur innovation, not prevent it. 
 
Here's another-universe hypothetical: Apple owns rights to all the technologies in iPhone and its look and feel. The courts rule that no one else can create a touchscreen phone, use proximity sensors, gestures or other functions. As a result, Apple locks up the market for smartphones, and no one else can compete. What happens? Innovation stops. Without competition, Apple has little incentive to innovate. iPhone prices remain high, and the company seeks to protect its market and sales position rather than develop something new. 
 
That just about describes every monopoly that ever existed. Another reason for the foundational principles behind patent law and the granting of limited-time monopoly: Prevent real monopolies from forming like this hypothetical one. 
 
Instead, Apple files patent and intellectual claims with the International Trade Commission and the courts against competitors like HTC or Samsung. Apple uses the legal process to prevent others from innovating, by engaging in competition by litigation. The company's legal filings accuse competitors of copying its products. 
 
But who's copying whom? Jobs' 1979 visit to Xerox PARC, where he was introduced to the concepts of graphical user interface and mouse that he later incorporated into Macintosh, is legendary. Apple is a notorious copier -- granted taking others' ideas and doing something else with them, or something at all. Few months back, I identified five things iOS 5 copies from Android, for example. I could write a lengthy post on Apple's copying practices, there are so many examples. 
 
But that's okay. Building on the work of others is how societies benefit. It's cornerstone of concepts like public domain or even fair use, and absolutely how patents are meant to be used -- not to protect one's invention but to spur even more from others. 
 
Is there something hypocritical here? That it's okay for Apple to copy --in Jobs' words steal -- but unacceptable for others to do the same or invent something new learned from Apple innovations? I pose the question to you.

 It appears that Apple has made a deal with patent troll Digitude Innnovations to help the company's efforts to sue nearly every major mobile device maker. Digitude earlier this month launched one of its first legal attacks against Nokia, RIM, Motorola, HTC, LG, Samsung, Sony, and even Amazon, filing a patent infringement claim with the International Trade Commission. Conspicuously absent from that list is iPhone maker Apple, which until late November owned two of the patents being used to target ""certain mobile devices"" from its competitors. 
 
As discovered by TechCrunch, Apple recently transferred ownership of a dozen patents to a shell company called Cliff Island LLC, which happens to share a New York office with the investment firm Altitude Capital Partners. Like Virginia-based Digitude, Altitude was founded by investor Robert Kramer. 
 
According to a Forbes report, Kramer's Altitude has in the past funded efforts to extract large settlements from the likes of Microsoft, RIM, and eBay over patent disputes. Earlier this year, Kramer put up $50 million of Altitude's funds to found Digitude. The money helped fund its acquisition of over 500 ""consumer electronics patents"" to both license and litigate. 
 
""Our goal is to generate great returns for our investors,"" Kramer told Forbes in June. ""We have reached out to many of our prospective customers to encourage them to become early strategic licensees."" 
 
Similar in some respects to Intellectual Ventures, Digitude makes deals with licensees for blanket access to its patent portfolio. Instead of money, however, Digitude prefers payment in patents it can use to either entice new licensees or sue the pants off them in court. 
 
Digitude claimed in April to have made its first strategic deal with ""one of the world's leading consumer electronics companies."" Though it didn't name the company specifically, the dozen patents Apple turned over to Cliff Island were acquired in April this year from Mitsubishi, and generally involve functions of ""mobile communications devices"" or ""mobile terminals."" 
 
Those patents were then transferred to Cliff Island in late November, with the two patents involved in the ITC dispute being transferred to Digitude the following day. Days later, Digitude filed its compliant with the ITC. Further cementing the connection between Apple and Digitude is the existence of a confidential license agreement involving both companies and filed as evidence in the ITC case. 
 
It's not clear just how complicit Apple is in Digitude's business, but EFF staff attorney Julie Samuels told TechCrunch that if Apple was deliberately aiding Digitude's patent trolling, ""it would be horrifying."" And even if Apple were somehow coerced into settling with Digitude, Samuels doubts that ""Apple didn't have any other options."" 
 
As we noted recently, Apple has a tendency to use its intellectual property in ways that seem inconsistent. For instance, an Opera developer claims that Apple has a pattern of using patents to slow down the W3C's open standards process, while promoting open standards when it gives Apple leverage against its competitors. This situation with Digitude seems similar; Apple opposes the tactics of patent trolls when they come after iOS developers, but seems to support them if it aids its ongoing legal battle for dominance of the smartphone market."

You cannot patent prior art,
obviously the... moreOver the last two years,Apple has been engaged in vicious legal battles over smartphone patents, many of which are aimed at squelching (or squeezing money out of) manufacturers of devices running Android. And now,for some reason,it has given valuable patents to a patent troll —which is using them to sue many of the top technology companies in the world. 
 
Meet Digitude Innovations,a firm based in Virginia that recently filed suit with the International Trade Commission alleging patent infringement by technology companies including RIM,HTC,LG, Motorola,Samsung,Sony,Amazon, and Nokia (note that Apple is not on this list). The ITC is a favorite for companies litigating over mobile phone patent disputes,as it can block the import of products long before a case has actually concluded. 
 
Digitude was founded in 2010 and raised $50 million from Altitude Capital Partners,with aims to “acquire,aggregate,and license key technology areas within the consumer electronics and related technology fields in a patent consortium” —in other words,it buys up patents and then sues other companies until they settle and agree to pay licensing fees, because it’s generally less expensive than actually going to court. 
 
From a Forbes article this past June: 
 
Digitude is a new kind of patent investment vehicle because it seeks to team up with strategic players that can invest in Digitude not with money,but by contributing patents. The contributing entity would then get a license for all of Digitude’s patents,[Digitude Chairman Robert] Kramer says. 
 
In April,Digitude announced the “completion of its first such strategic partnership with one of the world’s leading consumer electronics companies” —which it didn’t name. The company later announced that additional (unnamed) parties have jumped on board as well,who will receive a portion of Digitude’s proceeds based on the value of the IP each party contributed. 
 
Apple appears to be one of these participants,and may be the unnamed leading consumer electronics company that Digitude boasted about this past spring. Of the four patents that Digitude included in its claim this week,two were owned by Apple earlier this year,before they were transferred to Digitude. 
 
The patents in question: 
 
USPTO #6208879 —Mobile Information Terminal Equipment and Portable Electronic Apparatus 
 
USPTO #6456841 —Mobile Communication Apparatus Notifying User Of Reproduction Waiting Information Effectively 
 
In both cases,Apple transferred ownership of the patent to a company called Cliff Island LLC, which in turn transferred it to Digitude Innovations. In fact,Apple has transferred a dozen patents to Cliff Island LLC this year (though only two of these were named in this ITC suit). 
 
You probably haven’t heard of Cliff Island LLC,because it appears to exist in name only. There is a next to no information about the company available online —though the patent filing does include an address: 485 Madison Avenue,Suite 2300 in New York City. 
 
I was unable to find a phone number for the company,so I attempted to pay a visit to their office,only to find that it doesn’t appear to exist. But there are other tenants on the twenty-third floor of 485 Madison. One of which is Altitude Capital,the same IP-focused private equity firm that happened to lead Digitude’s $50 million funding round. 
 
Put another way,Apple appears to have transferred its patents to the patent troll Digitude,though it first routed them through a shell company that shares the same office as Digitude’s lead investor and Chairman. Further evidence of the relationship between Apple and Digitude can be found on the ITC’s own website,where a list of files relevant to the lawsuit can be found. Many of these files are marked confidential,but it appears someone mistakenly left the file names intact. One of which is “Digitude-Apple License Agreement” (see screenshot below). 
 
So what is going on? There are a pair of scenarios that seem plausible —though both of them are strange. 
 
The first is that Apple is using Digitude as a hired gun of sorts in its patent offensive,giving the company valuable patents to wield against its opponents (while avoiding the waves of press that are spurred by each new lawsuit). But Apple hasn’t exactly been quiet about suing its rivals over smartphone patents,so it’s not clear what they’d gain from this. 
 
The alternative is that Apple has given some of its patents to Digitude because the patent troll came after it first. The dozen patents Apple has handed over may have been part of a settlement with the firm,along with the license agreement (which would presumably give Apple the rights to its patents,and additional Digitude patents). This seems more likely. 
 
But even if Digitude shot first,so to speak,it’s still hard to see Apple in a positive light here. This is Apple we’re talking about. The idea that the company didn’t have any options other than handing over valuable patents to a patent troll —knowing full well that it would then use those patents to sue other tech companies —seems ludicrous. 
 
I spoke with Julie Samuels,Staff Attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who focuses on patents,who points out that in some cases certain companies will sell their patents to other parties when they’re under financial stress. But Apple clearly doesn’t fall into that bucket. 
 
If Apple were deliberately aiding Digitude,Samuels says “it would be horrifying —the patent troll problem is completely out of control. Apple has every legal right to sue over its patents,but it should be the one to do it”. 
 
And if Apple was indeed threatened first by Digitude,and only handed over its patents as part of a settlement,she says she “cannot imagine any reasonable scenario where Apple didn’t have any other options”. 
 
Both Apple and Digitude declined to comment."

Tech crunch have done a little digging and it appears that Cliff Island is a shell company, sharing a physical address with Altitude Capital, the main investor behind patent trolling company Digitude Innovations (ironic name, n'est pas?). 
 
Cliff Island then ""transferred"" those same patents to Digitude who have now filed a suit with the ITC (International Trade Commission) in the US against basically all the smartphone and tablet makers selling in America (RIM, HTC, LG, Motorola, Samsung, Sony, Amazon, and Nokia (note that Apple is not on this list). How mysterious.

So what we're seeing here is Apple suing its competitors out of the market, yet again, for patent law suites it already lost, but this time by proxy. And it's interesting that the patent transfers have taken place under some sneaky back-room sleight of hand. For new readers this might seem unethical even for Apple - what we know, is only the tip of the ice berg, unfortunately. Meanwhile, let me remind you this is all made possible thanks to a jerk with a very high function in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). You have probably heard of the web site PatentlyApple.com which publishes all Apple patents as soon as they are submitted to the USPTO.It is no wonder that Apple can get approved patents for products like the SmartCover which in fact steal InCase's design.

3309,"Anonymous, 26 Jul 2012iPhone was outsold already and its a fact that's hard for you to accept. You're a dreamer.What is going hard to accept are the damages plastic copy manufacturers will have to pay, I remember when Kodak made copies of the Polaroid instant camera: 
Types of non-Polaroid instant cameras 
Kodak EK6 Instant Camera 
Some of the earliest instant cameras were brought to market before Edwin Land's invention of the instant camera. These cameras are, however, more portable darkrooms than ""instant"" camera. After Land's patent was brought to market, many imitators surfaced, some using Polaroid-compatible film and equipment, such as cameras by Keystone, Konica, and Minolta. Others were incompatible with Polaroid cameras and film, the most notable of these being made by Kodak, such as the Kodamatic. These cameras accepted a Kodak-branded integral instant film, similar to Polaroid's SX-70 film. This was simple for Kodak, because Kodak had, in fact, manufactured film for Polaroid up to this point, thus they were privy to the manufacturing process. The Kodak film was chemically identical to the Polaroid version with the exception that the final print was viewed from the opposite side to the exposed surface. Polaroid brought a patent-infringement lawsuit against Kodak, and eventually Kodak was forced to stop manufacture of both the camera and film. Kodak was also left to pay a settlement to some customers who were left without a way to use their now-defunct cameras. (Many were offered $50 in Kodak stock). Kodak also lost the contract to manufacture Polaroid's film who now took production in house. 
Customers were offered the chance to exchange such Kodak cameras (e.g., the EK160-EF), for one of the new Disc cameras. Although many did make the swap, some did not trust the new disc format,[citation needed] especially in light of the instant picture camera fiasco and held onto their cameras. There are still many thousands available and even in mint condition with all the original booklets, instructions and carrying case they are worth little, and certainly far less than their original 1970s selling price.

Being fair to say that the S3 is plasticky and flimsy, design isn't the best compared to the looks of the 4s! Also another point is that you do NOT have to use itunes for everything! If your smart enough there are plenty of way of getting around this ie jailbreak AND other ways! Another point you mentioned is that the S3 can expand memory to 64GB, well sorry to say that the 4s has top end of 64gb and that's what I am using! The iphone is NOT all hype and brand new, just a lot of people using this handset because it's simply great! You sound pretty biased in your comments!

For performance and specs the S3 is incredible topping the 4S in every way. I have recently purchased the S3 after carefully running through all the top phones, and found it a brilliant device. With Apple you have to use iTunes for everything which gets extremely costly and having to sync or cloud is a huge pain. While with the S3 you can cloud if you want or just plug it into the pc. The 4S has no expandable memory while the S3 can have up to 64g. The camera on 4S also falls short compared with the S3. The screen on the S3 is hard to take your eyes off its so stunning and the extra size is an absolute must for anyone with bigger hands. At the end of the day most of my friends and family have had iPhones(3gs,4,4S) and are now using S2's, Nexus, S3's and HTC Ones and not one of them has ever looked back. People say the iPhones are great but when you talk to them most have only ever had an iPhone so of course to them its great until they try something else. Only then do they realise that the iPhone is all hype and brand name.   "

Many people nowadays think bigger is better. So if you are one of those then 4S will be a dwarf for you. 
If not, 3.5"" Retina is far suprior to 4.8"" HD screen. 
 
Next is Cores. Even tough the S3 sports a quad core beast inside it, there are not many applications that require that much processing power, and plus Android is very heavy OS as compared to iOS. So you will get same performance from Duel Core 4S and Quad Core S3. 
In my experiance, iOS gives a better experiance/reponsiveness than Android. 
 
Applications are not a problem as both AppStore & Google Play are on par right now. And, you may experaince some apps work better on iOS and some on android. 
 
If you are from US or any place with 4G LTE, and LTE is the way to go for you, then S3 with Duel Core processor is the only option. 
 
If you are willing to shell out money for a Flagship model, then why not wait for 2 months more, and conisder the Next Generation iPhone."

3414,"Terrible phone, had it for one month. 
Poor battery life, it only lasts less than a day with minimal use. 
The UI is too simple, not really fun to play around with. 
Siri is a stupid gimmick. 
This device is terrible since I can't do many things that you could do with a regular phone without jailbreaking it. 
Small screen, only reason why it has a larger PPI than most other phones. 
 
My carrier allowed me to switch phones and I've chosen  an Android phone and I love it. 
Better UI, fun to play around with. 
Not many restrictions like on the iPhone. 
More useful apps. 
No stupid auto correct."

so bro! Im must say welcome to apple/iOS world if its your first time here or using it! Goodluck for using it and injoy!"
3417,"I was one of those who liked Android phones before. I thought it was better than iPhone because of its openness and customization. But from every Android phone I had (samsung galaxy y, ace, s, s2), all of them disappoints me. I thought that if I go to higher-end phone like S2, I'll be satisfied. But not. Poor battery life. I was just playing games (Cut the Rope) and after 1-hour, it drains to 50%. I was already using a battery saver that time, Data connection, wifi, etc were all off. Frustrates me all the time. One more thing, the FC's and lags. It was always there. Whatever model or OS it is.  
 
This is the reason why I switched to iPhone. I must admit, it really looks fancy and cool. But that's not the only thing I loved about it. The battery could last for 2 days with 3G connection off. It has more awesome apps and games. I enjoyed using and discovering more uses of it. It runs smoothly, satisfies my daily needs (tech part). 
 
So my conclusion is... it's not always about the screen size, the RAM or the processor. Android and iOS are different. I can say that Android has larger memory because it a memory-hogger system and iOS isn't that's why 512mb is just right. It depends on the user's preferences. If you enjoy openness and customibility, choose Android. 
But if you like design, quality apps, less lags and OS stability, choose iOS.  
 
This is my opinion, so please, learn to respect. It's the device we're talking here, not the patents or company issues. "

Just curious, where you need 1gb ram? :) Apple knows very well what they are doing, if they think it doesn't need 1gb, it doesnt. iPhone run everything fast and smooth, it's always has been like that no matter what the specs says. Try to use iPhone 3gs and any other phone with same specs and you see big difference and you see numbers doesn't mean everything.

Apple put parts to iOS devices which they know works fast and smoot and which can handle the future stuffs too. They don't make underpowered devices, even if it might look on paper that they are."

Sroll down to see Nokia-Apple Patent dispute. Or see I copy and paste below for those lazy to go into the link. 
 
Nokia–Apple patent dispute 
In October 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc. in the U.S. District Court of Delaware citing Apple infringed on 10 of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer.[172] Apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in December 2009 accusing Nokia of 11 patent infringements. Apple’s General Counsel, Bruce Sewell went a step further by stating, ""Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours."" This resulted in an ugly spat between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in ""virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players, and computers.""[173] Nokia went on to ask the court to bar all U.S. imports of the Apple products including the iPhone, Mac and the iPod. Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010, the details of which are yet to be confirmed.[172] 
In June 2011, Apple settled with Nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of $600 million and royalties to Nokia.[174] The two companies also agreed on a cross-licensing patents for some of their patented technologies.[175][176]

Mate, im not being funny, but if you honestly think that £499 is cheap ($750 approx) then you are minted. I personally dont think the price is right as the 4S isnt quite the upgrade everyone hoped for. Should have charged a lower price. Suppose Apple are just re-couping what they put into the phone. But yeh, X Y or Z, people like their own phone because it suits THEM. No one else. So if you love Siri, hit the iphone, if you want free music downloads on Android, hit the SGS2, etc etc. Like some others have put earlier, the phone choice we get now is SO good, there really isnt a loser. But to say the 4S is cheap.......well.......you must be smoking your own name there Ganja, because its not."

How do we really know what RAM is in ip4s because Apple are very secretive with what they do..I think the whole system is using 512MB ram but SIRI is allocated a 128MB dedicated bank of RAM to operate..The only people who know this are Apple who can deny or just say nothing on the subject.Intel show just about the whole story on their chips..Just because the A5 has a spec it does not paint the whole picture ARM is a UK based manufacturer but Apple have designed the A5 chip to their spec .. 
 
Windows 32bit can only recognise 4GB of RAM so adding more will not make any difference,,how do we know that IOS has a maximun RAM recognition of 51MB and thats why the SIRI has another 128MB of RAM utilising the second core on the A5 chip ???"

Spot on. Excellent post. At the end of the day, when we buy a phone, we don't often think about it's future impact or how the future will change it. We just think, this is a great phone, what we should be considering is the way it will change phones in the future and the way it will be changed in the future.

I own a SGS, but I think you are wise to get an SGS2. It's a dual core processor, that currently doesn't truly utilize it's second processor, HOWEVER, you will own that phone for a few months, possibly years. Ice Cream Sandwich is on the way out and you will load that on knowing full well it's been designed to utilize your phone to it's fully capacity. I hope ICS will be supported by the SGS."

Intel Architecture has totally changed in the last few years and while you are totally correct the clockspeed has remained fairly constant but the speed has changed, don't you realize it's not just 'basic CPU' architecture that influences the speed of a computer. You numpty... SATA based hard drives? SSD hard drives? Increase in motherboard streamlining? RAID technology? Shed loads of things. The way you describe it sounds like you've attended one of your Computer Architecture classes on your Computer Science degree because you sound like a total retard. 
 
Benchmarking doesn't represent anything accurately. It gives a very generic overview of performance. Do you not realize that the overhead of using a Benchmark tool actually changes the performance? If you do what I do for a living, where timing can be a key, a debugging tool, benchmarking tool etc, can totally fuck up a set of results that you need to achieve to hit some sort of required point. 
Not only that, you fail to understand that different CPU architectures are generally optimized to work with certain tasks. Have you ever benchmarked a IA64 processor? They have quite a low clockspeed and your dog shit benchmarks would show them to be a naff piece of hardware. The fact they cost several THOUSAND dollars because of the way in which they are able to handle huge amounts of 64bit data totally slips your uneducated Apple loving brain.

More RAM does use slightly more battery. You being a self titled expert in the field would know the workings of various RAM types, such as DRAM and SRAM right? Errrrrrrr no, clearly you know absolutely nothing. DRAM actually requires a fairly small amount of power in general and an increase in RAM would make a very insignificant change. Further to your Apple loaded clairvoyant space brain that immediately gives you more knowledge on every subject than anyone else, you of course would realize that one of the biggest battery drainers is the screen, and by that, not just the size, but the pixel density and resolution. Seeing as Apple have just upped their resolution quite a lot, (despite there being no visible change to 99.999999% of the population), there will be a much greater drain on battery from that end of the device. Seeing as I feel like I'm the only one who can be objective on this subject, and not turn into an Android fanboy, I'd like to point out that a device should suit the user based on personal preference and not some quest for social status like this knob cheese Doctor Thomas Cockend seems to suggest. If I was you, I would consider various devices. Small Android devices, midrange Android devices, larger Android devices and the iPhone. Personally, I prefer Android devices since switching my allegiance from Symbian, but that doesn't mean I don't respect iPhone. 
 
As for some of the other dog shit that people are posting, I think you muppets should go and do a bit more research before you...

-Battery kills the iPhones. (2 days, iP4 1 day = DOUBLE) 
-1GB ram really makes for all the widgets (moving) to operate the phone smooth as silk 
-iPhone 4 is smooth as silk too, but its such a simple set up... Just iCONS! 
-Screen Res to the iPhone 
-Screen QUALITY to the SGS2 
-Wanna download a free song quickly? Android. 
-Wanna go an the iTunes? Apple iPhone (get your credit card ready:P)

Beating android apps for any company is very difficult even for apple.

For instance, what about all the doctors, nurses, medical students who use iPhone and iPad and the contributions mentioned in this article? 
 
http://mobihealthnews.com/2580/timeline-the-iphone-as-medical-tool/  
 
Pilots are also now moving to iPads.  
 
Are they doing so to show off? Or is it because simple can also mean reliable. If a guy was flying you 30,000 in the air, would you rather him have a simple, reliable device, or something that he may have to figure out and not be able to use intuitively? 
 
The iPhone fortunately, is as simple, or as complex as the owner wants it to be, due to the App Store. Surely a kid who uses it as a gaming device, is not the same as a Doctor who uses medical apps, or a teenager who likes Whatsapp and Facetime, to a millionaire who buys it for his girlfriend cos its cool, to a hardworking person who bought it as a reward for himself. 
 
Sure there are those who buy it for shallow reasons, but the iPhone crowd runs the whole gamut of people, just like in real life.  
 
Are you also telling me, that ALL android buyers are noble? No criminal will buy an SGS2? Only smart people buy HTC? 
 
Stereotyping people is a useless exercise in futility, better to concentrate on the positive.

However the technical answer is, at a certain distance, you... moreYou're right on most part, but let me correct you a bit :) The pixel density on the SGSII and the iPhone is 217 and 329 respectively. What this means is, that the iPhone screen is much sharper, and will be able to portray much more info (and much more detail) on a smaller area, so essentially, it will be better in sharpness at any given distance. Now, the 329 ppi of the Retina screen are very, very close to the capacity of the human eye, so if you have average sight, you won't be able to tell the pixels apart even if you look at it very closely. As for the GSII, you will be able to see the pixels, but only if you look at it very up close, probably closer than you will ever bother to look. And the advantage of the Super Amoled Plus is contrast. It has the highest contrast (practically infinite) of any smartphone screen out there (except Super Amoled itself ofc), so you will have eye-popping colors.

5596,"Caution. What he sells to you is something that does not work. I opened my ""brand new"" (purchased thinking it was new not refurbished) iphone and tried to set it up while I was in the car. It told me to hook it up to itunes so I did on my laptop, but it gave me an error. Took it to the apple store and i was notified that it had been wet. That there was a red spot on top of the phone that notifies that it had been tainted with water. I notified the seller and he tried to blame it on me saying that if I had wet it somehow. Like really? I got it and saw it did not work and took it to the apple store, which I was told that I would have to buy a whole new one because this phone does not have warranty in any way not even the 30 day warranty that you should get and he advertises. I would ask the seller questions about the iphone and he was very rude. I asked him if I can have a refund and he said ""Well I guess knowing the amazon policies"". So if it was up to him he would not refund anything, even though he is selling cheap stuff that does not work at all. It is just a waste of money if you guys go and buy from him."
5597,"The 4S is a dated phone from 2011, so the iOS is barely current and it is so small but the most concerning factor is the poor battery life.  I had bought a 64 GB memory 4S from another supplier that was horrid in this regard, draining within minutes from a full charge.This phone is far better so it gets the nod for backup duties.  Given another choice, I’d go with a 6S for about what I paid for these pair of 4S phones.  Live and learn."
5598,I am very disappointed with how this phone is functioning. From he very first day I got it the phone was malfunctioning. It doesn't hold charge for long. The bar would say 78% charge yet the phone will still shut down. The charger charges sometimes. I am soo not satisfied with this product. It is not functioning like a new phone. More like a refurbished one. Either the battery or he charger isn't good but it's not fear to me to have to spend all that money to get something that is malfunctioning.
5599,"Advertised as:  New, in the box, sealed w/ original shrink-wrap, never opened, iPhone 4S, factory unlocked.  Received item not shrink-wrapped, w/ minor marring on edges of iPhone, locked to AT&T, dirty places on box.  No way this is just a ""mistake.""  Clearly, a mass hit or miss on order recipients as to who will or will not make a fuss about it, and odds are, many will use AT&T as their carrier upon receipt so it would not even come up.  Hate being baited and switched by anyone.  Have asked for return and replacement, but will change to just return and refund as do not trust seller now."
5600,"It functions as an iPhone. I'll give you that. The description says ""never opened"" and ""new in shrink wrap and original packaging"" though mine came with a screen glitch which lead me to believe this was a used phone. And it was because it had a tiny chip in the phone and the camera failed to focus unless you shook the phone a few times.
Nonetheless, it's been almost 6 months and there haven't been any problems aside from the screen glitch. It's better than no iPhone."
5601,"This is a lie my Iphone came opened and with no original charger also it comes tight with a garbage bag closure, I feel cheated!! Do not buy from them."
5602,Buen producto
5603,"Great phone... I have had many cell phones but because my apt has many dead zones no other phone has worked as well as this 32GB iPhone 4.  With this phone, I can go almost anywhere with the phone and I have rarely any dropped calls... Its great not to have to sit in one place in my house to talk on the cell..."
5604,"I did love this iPhone however; I had to replace the battery twice, and ultimately I can nolonger use this iPhone because I let it update to iOS 9.2 and it froze my phone to recovery mode with the itunes logo. I chatted with 3 techs on apple.com to try to resolve the issue, and from 11pm to 4am, this iPhone would not recover back to normal, so I took it to an apple store later in the day, and to my sadness, the phone could not be restored, they offered to sell me another iPhone being that this phone was pass warrenty, the replacement phone would have cost way more than the price that I paid for this phone. I am very upset, because I just recieved a new battery for the phone last week, and I had just received an iHome that I purchased the same day that this happened, and here is the kicker... I had just put minutes on this phone 5 minutes before letting it update.... So dissapointed"
5605,"The main touch button give hard time to switch page/screen.

When I read the review about this I PHONE

• Apple iPhone 4S 32GB White - Unlocked by Apple
• Used, Very Good
• In Stock
• Shipped from: MobileSpree
• Gift options not available. Learn more"
5606,the iphone I am sure is great but I have used an android phone for years so for me the iphone was alittle crazy. But after reading the book for dummies for the iphone 4s it was easier. I am not very tech savy. so for anyone else I think the phone would be great.
5607,"HI, great phone, I like it. Bought it because its a little cheaper, and to be honest can't afford to spend so much on the latest gadgets being the price that they are. However, i do like the Iphone 4S. Very good, very reliable - of course the Iphone5 an up is better, but hey, I can't afford to pay that much extra just so i can have better and bigger typing screen as well as a few other things. Don't really use it my self but my other half does and she loves, i think maybe a little more then me - she spends more time on it then she does talking to me. Anyway, my little gripe aside, good product."
5608,"This phone was quite beaten up, certainly not good condition
It had the new IOS on it , which I prefer to avoid, as not coming from Silicon valley, or having a skateboard, I dont enjoy finding out the bugs... I chose this 4S as I wanted 32GB, 4G, Siri and the much better camera (8MP) than my old 4..and the system is more stable

Good news, the vendor is exchanging it for me."
5609,"Good morning through this I want to inform you day March 4, 2015 to buy the Iphone 4S 32 Gb in this shop by amazon with a little delay I came the day June 8, 2015 the phone shows Charge Fail and the first day at 100% charge but on reaching the 45% the phone is switched off and not turned back on unless it is connected to the charger and appears with the same 45% load with which the pile was extinguished not download completely want to see that give solution to my problem as I am in Venezuela waiting a pleasant answer ..... I say goodbye to you

France Magallanes"
5610,"Phone was in great condition, works great, USB charge cord it came with fell apart, but seller next day had new cord sent, and responded immediately to my email

Very happy with this, highly recommend"
5611,"I bought this old model as I liked it better than the new, bigger models. The description explicitly said ""unlocked"", which means the phone should work anywhere with any SIM card. When I moved to Italy from the U.S., it could not read any SIM card. The phone is NOT u locked and this description is misleading and must be reported. I wish I could get a total refund for this lie."
5612,"The product came with no problems, damage (other than a few scratches from regular use because I bought a used one) I bought this to replace my ipod touch 4th gen that served me well since January of 2010. So far this iphone has served me well as a replacement ipod. I love it!"
5613,Im not exactly happy with this purchase as II believe that i received a dead battery. All I have ever been able to do with the phone is forward it to another number .
5614,I gave this transaction a 2 because their is a dis colored section of screen which was not stated and although comes in original box no headphones were included. Besides that phone works fine.
5615,"I BOUGHT IPHONE FROM THIS BUYER,BEFORE LEAVING USA.
I ORDERED WHITE PHONE, BUT I GOT BLACK, AS I AM HURRY IN TRAVELLING, COMPROMISED WITH COLOR AND LEFT COUNTRY.
WHEN I REACHED HOME I GOT ONE MORE SHOCK, PHONE IS NOT UNLOCKED, SPENT AROUND 3 DAYS AND 50$ ON UNLOCKING THE PHONE.
AFTER UNLOCKING, SHOCKED AGAIN BECAUSE BATTERY IS TOO WEAK AND CHARGE IS DRAINING WITHOUT USAGE, I NEED TO CHARGE THRICE IN A SINGLE DAY. IF I OPEN ANY APPS, THE PHONE GETS HEATED SOON."
5616,"Not the white one I initially intended... I got a black one instead. And the headphone jack started having problems from the getgo. But to be fair the seller did offer to exchange it or offer me a full refund but at the time I just needed a phone so bad, that's why I'm I can't give him full 5 stars. But been using it for afew months now and no complaints."
5617,"When the phone arrived, I was unable to use it, due to the phone not holding a charge. Also, the screen sometimes fades and goes blank. This is very disappointing!"
5618,Excelente
5619,"This phone seems to be a Brand New Phone, so I bougth this phone for a Nephew and he is very happy with it. On the other hand is unlocked as we wanted it, so I was afraid with it but when we got it we became happy with the selection we did it."
5620,Good
5621,"As described. However, the battery dies at 18% if it not in Low Power Mode. It charge up quick though."
5622,"iPhone appeared new however the battery was not great.  As time went by the battery got worse and worse to the point where not only could it not hold power, it had to be continuously connected to the wall in order for the phone to remain open and working.  All this within months of purchase.  Within 6 months of use it became useless."
5623,Did work great
5624,Has a few minor blemishes which I expected being refurbished but was able to insert my Sims card and successfully set it up with no issues. Very satisfied with the purchase and time frame in which I received it.
5625,Has bugs. Apple reps said to upgrade...... This is too expensive an item to throw out and upgrade.  No more apple for me.......
5626,"Nice product, will buy from this vendor again."
5627,My wife loves this iPhone so much... Thank you !!!
5628,"Very happy! Using my new phone now.
Thanks!"
5629,This Apple iPhone 4s works great!
5630,"I recommend it, thank you very much"
5631,I love this phone.  It came to me within a week from Japan unlocked and there isn't one thing wrong with it.  Thank you!!!!!
5632,Love this so much more than used on Craigslist
5633,Very satisfied
5634,this is my first iphone.... so cool....
5635,"I ordered a refurbished version of the phone thinking it would be fine. The customer service I received through the process, like when I had to cancel the order and re-order it was amazing, both from amazon and the seller. However once I received the phone, the camera on it was all out of whack, making pictures turn green or other strange colors. I live overseas in Korea now and there are no apple stores here, so I took it to someone who did repairs who had to take out the camera and put in a new one because the one it had was a fake. Next time I'll go for the new one. Besides this no issues except a crap battery but that seems to be common with iPhones."
5636,100% recomendado very good
5637,EXCELENTE
5638,lovely phone now and tomorrow
5639,"I am so pleased that I purchased this phone!  I was using a Google Nexus 4 and it just didn't feel ""right.""  After going back to the iPhone, I am so happy!!This was a great buying experience too!  The seller was super speedy on shipping and the price was AMAZING for a MINT-condition iPhone 4S!  Thanks for such a great buying experience!!"
5640,Not new as advertised...USED
5641,"The device is bad the battery is very week,  tested the battery with Apple guys said,  the device was in use was more than 7 years and the battery has almost gone,  I'd to replace a new battery paying $80 to apple.  Totally frustrated!!!"
5642,is good.

5652,It was gift and my cousin love it.... Thank you.... will do business again.
5653,Bought it for my daughters Christmas present I cant tell anything about an IPhone
5654,"the phone worked only one month and the problem is that it was at a premium of Venezuela a gift, it was a total fiasco and i do not know if it is warranted because the period amazon and return step, a waste of money"
5655,i loved thank you the phone look great
5656,Very good item...Thanks
5657,excelent
5658,It don't work for T-Mobile i went to the store and they said it was with Verizon and sprint so if you have those your good but when I got the phone is was in great condition
5659,"Big cheater. Item described as new sealed in box , iPhone 4s . Received the item. It's used even the box not the original and those accessories are old."
5660,i  like it
5661,The seller lied，and the iphone is not new， it is used and does not work at all.  The battery isbroken，the power went out  in ten minutes，charging is very difficult。so I am very angry. Don't buy this one.
5662,This phone was supposed to be unlicked and was not. It was in good shape though!
5663,excellent
5664,"If you are the type of person that always wants to have the newest gadget: stop reading here.
For all the others that want to have a great phone at a great price: the iPhone 4S is your first choice. It offers a lot more than the 4 and not a lot less than the 5. Believe me: this is a great deal."
5665,"im sorry but my IPhone 4S 32 GB is not working perfectly, the battery does not charge, i would like to know about guarantee, what can i do??"
5666,Screen was cracked! Charger plug didn’t work!
5667,"Arrived on time. The charger on the other hand didn't work.. no biggie though, the phone does and chargers are cheap:)"
5668,Very good
5669,"Nice iPhone in original box, prompt delivery, A++++++"
5670,GREAT GJ
5671,"I ordered 2 of these phones.
Pro: They arrived as described: factory unlocked. Shipping was quick
Con: Charger and headphones do not appear to be Apple products."
5672,Its very fast and looks good At the beggining but now runs hot and the back cover is not original
5673,The guy cheat to me because he sent me locked phone without headphone but I ordered locked phone. I am kind of dissapointed
5674,what a buy!
5675,Good!
5676,This is very bad. I ordered a 32 gb factory unlocked iphone I got a 16 GB with bad wifi and not really god battery.
5677,Took too long for delivery. Very happy with my phone.
5678,"My flash does not work. I receive only the cable, without battery.
I don't have the legal document to requist the consert, so now what can i do?"
5679,I had no problems getting it hooked up with my carrier and have not had any issues come up with the phone. I have had it for several months with no problems
5680,"the product was bad. You were offered unlocked,but it was locked, i got to pay 80 more to unblock it, today the phone is damaged,"
5681,Great iPhone for the price
5682,Said it was unlock.. It was locked with AT&T. So I have Verizon and my gf has AT&T.. But the phone looks new and works perfectly.
5683,thought I posted the review before. but I love it.
5684,excellent product in good condition and the delivery was as expected immediate
5685,Worst experience with this phone. its not a new phone and hs serious battery problem and also the speaker is also not working
5686,It was in great shape but i didn't want a international phone without facetime and it wouldn't take my card for a u.s.a. t-mobile.
5687,has problems with wifi
5688,"A slight problem with charger, when my phone connected with charger a little bit shocking I got,  please solve my problem"
5689,"The iphone came in the original wrap but after contacting Apple because of some problems, I discovered the phone had previous owner."
5690,I love the look of the white!

5698,"Seler sent a broken, two years used product. Still no answering for more that one week now."
5699,It shipped faster than what was confirmed with me and the product was exactly what I wanted.
5700,goodnight you have black iphone accessories ?

5704,"Perfect delivery, and match as per my requierement, and perfect packaging. And Good quality and looks very nice plastic color. Fast connection"
5705,"Really good buy... It does show a lil use on the sides n a few minor nicks, a bumper can easily cover up screen n back are in perfect condition the fone really is unlocked n for half the price it normally goes for i would highly recommend them.. And I got the phone before the estimated delivery day very pleased with my new iPhone"
5706,"ok, good jod"
5707,I received it with out Sim card. There is no Sim card.
5708,It's very good
5709,very good!!!!!+++++++++
5710,"It's Apple, you know... :)"
5711,"this is very different, we paid for a factory unlocked iPhone, and you sent one of AT&T that is not honest. I pay less for a locked phone, thanks."
5712,My cell phone carrier said an unlocked phone like this one would not be able to text outside the wi-fi network??? I went to 2 other shop and they also were warning me of issues i would have. finally I emailed mobilespree. I got a reply the same evening with the procedure to make it work easily. It solved my issues. I love my Iphone 4S. Works perfectly.
5713,brand new no problem
5714,"When we bought the phone it turend out to be locked which made it difficult to use the phone on another SIM card, but the seller was kind enough to follow up with at&t and have it unlocked in a short time . The iphone arrived in mint condition with an utter box cover. It was a good buy after all."
5715,EXECELLENT ALL THE WAY....
5716,Was not like they said it was not unlocked
5717,Pour battery life time!!! it does not stand even one hour!!!!!
5718,They didnt work at all dont buy from them no more

6095,Original Packing recently manufactured product.
6096,"it's not just a phone , but a peace of mind. Such a smooth and fast user experience that is unmatched with any of it's rival companies.

Also at the current price it's just a killer. I wouldn't have purchased it when it was 35 -40 k plus , not because of quality but only because the price was too much for me.

Currently have more then 18 apps installed and the phone works just as awesome as a phone works on day one you get it new. Had this been an android , with a gb ram and quad core processor , it will just start dying within first 2 days of purchase.

Dont listen to all the critics, I have come a long way using most expensive android and windows phone and I can guarantee you that you cant get this sort of experience in any other OS"

6148,Superb
6149,although its one of the old product by apple but still worth to its value.
6150,"this iPhone is a successful model by apple.
the design is evergreen that comes with all glass in front and back with alluminium frame.
so it is quite heavy that after continuous use in hours feels fatigue your hands.
iPhone 4s has 1434 mah battery that good with offline use like use of camera,music,gaming... but when you use internet it drains faster   and second thing that is annoying is it heated in short time of use.
you have to charging daily for simple use..
lets talk on the other features....
the most amazing thing is its camera it is a masterpiece of apple  the pictures taken with this are so wonderful... various edits r comes inbuilt you  do not have to install any image editor.... various modes like panorama,photo,video,timelapse.
the sound quality is nice
processor is good no any fault in gaming or any other apps
but memory is a thing that affect the overall personality of this phone
you don't have scope to save all of the things 
you have to remain in only 5 gb space but if u use the icloude u don't worry
the quality of display is super..
you don't feel that is 4 years old technology it gives you a brighter and amazing display
apple gives you a year warranty
go with this 
this is apple"
6151,I like it my phone iPhone 4s it's awesome

6223,Iphone 4s is the best and affordable phone at this price range .The phone looks classy and cool.Works nicely better sound clearity and the camera works good for nice and clear snaps.other than the android devices ios works way much better and cool no lags no problems at all
6224,Overall: I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices.

6301,"After years of torture using Android, symbian and windows phone ( galaxy , lumia )
finally I got what every phone user deserves in the first place.

it's not just a phone , but a peace of mind. Such a smooth and fast user experience that is unmatched with any of it's rival companies.

Also at the current price it's just a killer. I wouldn't have purchased it when it was 35 -40 k plus , not because of quality but only because the price was too much for me.

Currently have more then 18 apps installed and the phone works just as awesome as a phone works on day one you get it new. Had this been an android , with a gb ram and quad core processor , it will just start dying within first 2 months of purchase.

Dont listen to all the critics, I have come a long way using most expensive android and windows phone and I can guarantee you that you cant get this sort of experience in any other OS

This is my first iphone and I am using it for past 10 days and I am quiet happy with it.
PROS- 1 Good battery life ( my usage is very low )
2 Excellent retina display.
3 Good sound quality an alternate for an ipod.
4 Best touch interface I have ever used.
5 Better build quality ( no plastic feel )
6 Superb camera.
CONS- 1 No direct access to the inbuilt memory on connecting with PC.
Apart from that I am quiet happy with the iphone 4s and the service experience provided by Snapdeal,thanks and keep it up."
6302,"i purchased a 4s iphone from snapdeal , its a good new piece and i am happy with the purchase"

6376,Good mobile

6380,V. Gud
6381,"Good product ,cheap price (couldn't get it cheap elsewhere), great service(received with a minor defect although a new one the best thing being Snapdeal people offered to replace it promptly but the minute defect can be ignored in the sway of delight of using the best product at least price as the quality says everything) and what else u need when you are getting it with 1 year brand warranty. It's just a supplementary experience for me as I personally have had many such great experiences in the past also only on Snapdeal!  Cheers!!"
6382,"Apple known for their excellent products. Iph 
4 s is one of the best phone in iPhone series
Now today 4 s price is also very competitive 
So according to price range and also in performance 
I am very happy to have it."
6383,Product is good but not happy with the te taken by the courier service to deliver
6384,Amazing device by apple. Amazing ratina display with smoothest touch out there nice battery and application support is outstanding. It's a style statement and no other phone can beat it or compare it. I used 30 or something android and windows phones but i truly satisfied by this amazing device.
6385,"this phone is very good ,i like this"
6386,It's good to use as it contains many apps which u don't have to download from other site
6387,"Great phone, apart from brand value awesome picture quality and sound, apt foir taking selfie.
But the phone gets heated up very fast while talking and while charging."
6388,This mobile is amazing .
6389,This piece is the best around 13k .. It has no problems except the charging-it goes faster.. All other features are outstanding and I would like to recommend this phone
6390,"The iPhone 4S is a good-looking piece of kit. I'm writing for a black model, but there is also a white model available.It still looks and feels expensive, and, while it's thicker than the newer iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s models, it's still only 9.3mm (the iPhone 5s is just 7.6mm thick). It does feel heavier though, at 140 grams.The iPhone 4S has a 3.5in display. I find that the smaller display means the iPhone 4s fits in my pocket nicely, and is easy to carry around. Of course, there are disadvantages to having the smaller screen, but that's not a big deal. The iPhone 4S has a complete glass back. The iPhone 4S 3.5in display is 960-by-640 pixels, with a screen resolution of 326 pixels per inch, making it Retina standard. The rear-facing camera in the iPhone 4S is an 8-megapixel iSight camera. It has an f/2.4 aperture and can shoot 1080p video. Apple's iPhone 4S is powered by an Apple-designed dual-core A5 processor. iPhone 4S can handle most of the tasks I want to carry out swiftly, but if speed is top of your priority list then the iPhone 4S probably isn't for you. Apple claims that the iPhone 4S provides up to eight hours of talk time on 3G, up to 200 hours on standby, up to six hours of 3G internet browsing or up to nine hours of WiFi internet browsing. But without doubt, iPhone 4S needs to be charged every day. Pros Cheaper than iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s Can run iOS 7 Cons Smaller display than iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s Poor battery life"
6391,"Once I have started using iPhone, I can't imagine of an alternate"
6392,"No one can beat the apple. The iPhone 4S is the benchmark of apple's new designed edition phone. Clear sound quality, never hangs up like android phones. A class marking phone image (showoff), feels awesome. Fits in budget thanks to snapdeal for nice deals. Atleast you can trust the snapdeal for this type of products. But there are some cons too that you can not use the Bluetooth for exchange the stuff. also can not do much as you can with android devices.
Overall apple is apple.
Must buy if you are a class conscious person.."
6393,iPhone simply the best
6394,Perfect
6395,"This apple i phone 4S is good to see but there is only one problem its battery is heating very quickly during using a phone , at the time of charging and hotspot connectivity this problem increases too much folds."

    Can not be in use in 4G networks.
    Differences battery life is not too large in comparison with the previous battery.      

It seems iPhone 4S does not bring many changes to the previous iPhone, the iPhone 4."
6430,all were good in its class but little bit problem with battery talktime .....it was downing very soon
6431,good
6432,I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying a high end smartphone like Samsung or some others which offer similar features for high prices. If you are on minimal budget 10k - 15k then go for this. If you are concerned about the brand and status then no one can stop you from opting for other brands.
6433,"At this price point iPhone 4 s is the best option.
Pros-best camera,best app ecosystem,best looks.
Cons-battery life is a trade off(works longer on 2g),relatively smaller screen
If you want to switch from android to Apple this is your best chance at a fraction of cost."
6434,"i was using an nokia E - series phone. i was bit disappointed by the sudden change form easy to use nokia to iphone. but with in a week i was able to know this product  is flawless. I not only liked it, i am in love with my new phone. A sincere thanks to Steve Jobs."

6492,"I was sceptical about the shipping company ecom express after reading their reviews. 

But i was really surprised and the product was delivered in perfect condition well before time.

As for the product itself, its really good. 8gb is the indicated space but what we really get after discounting the RAM usage and all the other necessities we get around 5.3 gb. I can work with that but might be a con for others.

All in all I am a very satisfied customer. Thank you snapdeal."

Very smooth and very fast in all aspects. For trial run i used 2G network and it works very fast.so when we use 3G it will be outstanding. Very easy to use and very user friendly.

Thanks to Snapdeal for your ever Fastest and delivery of 'Genuine' products."
6529,I found the purchase and delivery methods of snapdeal to be hastle free and quite unlike what I had heard from other people. The phone is quite good although a bit expensive for its worth. The battery life could have been longer.
6530,"Touch is great, nice looks, very fast and no lags, headphone provided is great, very nice display, clear and crisp"
6531,"I was checking all the online shopping websites to find the best price for iPhone 4S and I finally found it on Snapdeal. The phone is 100 % genuine and brand new.

I've seen some pictures and news articles and also posts on FB stating that they ordered an iPhone and they receive a brick or something. Its all fake guys, I've ordered it and I've received a genuine phone which is brand new. Its just that haters want to degrade the name of Snapdeal.

Anyways, overall I'm very happy with the phone and Snapdeal services, it was a gift for my mom and she loved it.

PS: You can also check the images that I've included with it. :)"
6532,"So far so good. The phone is original and works absolutely fine. Snapdeal offering is the best across online stores but the apple website mentions only Fliipkart to be their only  online authorized partner. May make you a little wary but that's OK as long as Snapdeal is selling this product with Apple India warranty, you should be fine."
6533,"Received the phone in sealed original iphone box. I feel 8 GB memory is too small, so I would recommend with 16 or 32GB."
6534,Got iphone 4s 8 GB phone with great offer @ snapdeal
6535,I received Genuine Iphone from Sanpdeal at a great price. Thank you snapdeal.
6536,I BUYED THIS PRODUCT FOR MY MOM AND SHE LOVED IT IN THIS PRICE I WOULD RECOMMEND EVERYONE TO BUY IF YOU LOVE APPLE IPHONES!!
6537,"With 5 months usage, i will say it as the perfect phone with best features and definitely it added credits to my appearance. 

Pros:
1.Best look....Black colour has more sexy look that too when display screen in off condition.
2.Better performance...Work smoothly even when more than 20 app opened in background
3.Awesome Camera...I personally found that in quality aspect that 16mp of other phone can never with even iphone's 8mp
4.Good battery life...Few of my friends told that battery life is not good before i bought. But personally i find that it can stand for 24hr when you charge in proper cycle. After watching a full 2.5hr movie, more than 40% charge will be left in phone. I installed app to maintain proper charging cycle. 
Cons:
1.Data Transfer : Synchronization is required every time to exchange data between system and phone...its a great headache when to want transfer a song or data instantly from any other system without iphone software installation.
2.Low Alert sound: As compared to other phone alert sound is low but for watching movie and you tube videos it has better sound.
3.Unique Charging port: Need to carry the charging port everywhere i go as its design is unique. General Universal cable can not be used to charge.
4.Glass finish: Both side of the phone is finished with glass so need to be handled with care."
6538,"got the phone, awwww sorry IPHONE as i needed in the budget. thank u snapdeal."
6539,Excellent product and very fast delivery!

6544,"*I ordered this iPhone in August 2014 and got the latest edition iPhone which is July 2014 made. I totally satisfied with Snapdeal.

6545,"awesome phone, awesome service, snapdeal rocks."
6546,"Really worthy Apple. 100% Genuine product. No duplicate. Snapdeal delivery also good. Phone is really awesome. Fully loaded and a bit heavy. You can several processes at one time, but it will not hang. One problem though it requires complete battery charge often throughout the day."
6547,"hey guys . i just want to tell about my experience about this phone IPHONE 4S
i have been using this phone and here's my review
PROS
superb camera quality 
awesome display (retina display) is just too good)
Ios no doubt is the best no lags whatsoever running 7.1.2 flawlessly 
awesomme BUILT quality
sound quality also good 
CONS 
small screen size(if you dont want a bulky phone and want a good phone 4s is the best)
battery backup isnt that great in 3G network barely a day but in 2g full day 

overall if you dont have a iphone you dont have one 
i am very happy with my phone , i have used a lot of android phones in my life but Iphone is iphone but comparison , at first i never liked iphone because of overprice but now i understand why its price is high , yes they give you value of money .
so steal it 
yes if you want a big screen phone with a lot cooler features go for HTC desire 816 or if you want a good phone at this segment 4S is the best
Thank you"
6548,"If you can afford it and want the greatest, you won't be disappointed with an offer provided by snapdeal for iPhone 4S."
6549,apart from delayed delivery phone is perfect..
6550,"At the outset, apologies for writing a review after ages from the date of purchase. No, never really got time for this.

Bought this as a birthday gift for my Missus in August 2014.

The packaging was very nice and the product was delivered within the promised date.

I was totally new to the apple eco-system and so was my wife. She was using the Sony Sola prior to this phone.

She does photography as a hobby with her Canon DSLR. So, she knows a thing or two about the lenses. She was really impressed with the camera onboard of the 4s.

Apart from that, she's got used to the apple ecosystem pretty quickly and is happy with the overall performance. She doesn't use any resource hungry app nevertheless. Basic telephony, google search for images, whatsapp, Candy crush and a couple more arcade games are what finds use on her phone. Battery lasts a day easily for her usage apparently.

To sum up, she's very happy with her birthday gift and the phone performs flawlessly as I write this review."
6551,Phone is running very slow..
6552,great phone if ur a apple lover go 4 it....
6553,"happy to get it...it's awesome....

6562,exellent
6563,"very nice

only constraint is its battery which drain too fast.

6564,"It's awesome phone ,no doubt .Truly I love iphone , and thank you Steve for your creation.
Snap deal should change the pic of phone because new phone contains iOS 7 and the pic showing ios4 ."
6565,Apple iphone 4s is perfect one. All the facilities available in my finger tips.

6580,But don't buy in snapdeal. These stupid snapdeal people giving my product after booking of 28 days
6581,"brilliant product from apple. u cant compare with other brands. has its own definition for creativity. simply AWsme. The only drawback i found is bluetooth, it doesnt even coneect to other apple devices."
6582,"Very Good , Best of All"
6583,Iphone 4S which I had booked developed fault in just 5 minutes of usage. Had to run from pillar to post to get it rectified. had lot of mental and physical trouble. Product not worth its money.
6584,"If you are not a heavy duty smart-phone user deep into gaming or photography then this is an excellent model for you. With iCloud integration you dont need to worry too much about running out of space. In terms of build quality and reliability the 4s is one of the best ever models of the iPhone. No ""bendgates"" here. And now it comes at a delicious price point enough to make even the fence sitters hungry. Battery life is not great though. So, take this into consideration when you decide to buy it."
6585,Go with snapdeal. Best phone at best price.
6586,Good Phone at this price range
6587,Love the quality of the phone. I am happy with the device and I think it is a great smartphone and people should really buy it rather than buying an expensive versions. If you have a small budget buy this one.

I decided to get a new phone instead and ended up buying this one. It is a very nice phone.

6688,apple was best at innovation at that time..but I will recommend to wait for price drop further 15 K INR or around should be phone
6689,"good phone, no problem"
6690,i first thought of purchasing iphone 5c 8Gb but again i saw some articles in internet that both these phones will get ios 8 update thats why i choose  iphone 4S so why should i give some more bucks for the same thing just the chip is different in iphone 5c and ram is bit more in iphone 5c but apart from that everything is same note that no budget android phones or lumia phones stand in front of an iphone so i recommend everyone to go for it who has limited budget but want to experience iphone
6691,"Apple IPhone, name is enough. Every apple product justifies the hype around it and this product is no different. Overall I am very happy to have decided to buy this"
6692,"It was my very long time intention to buy an IPhone because ihave all other I's with me except this.Now I am so happy that I have an IPhone...it's very nice to hold,see,use...easy to operate...doing good,yet to explore all the other apps on that.I am enjoying it."

6751,I am still getting accustomed to the i-phone but overall am very happy with it and enjoying all its various features. I would recommend it highly in this price band.
6752,"I realized what apple is after owning an iphone 4s and why its a craze among people . none of my friends have an apple as they think its a stupid waste of money. I myself has used every single brand of phones and operating systems. from Nokia to HTC and from Windows phone to Blackberry OS. but what amazed me is the iOS and its simplicity. even if its fast its very simple to use and the interface is something that even a child can understand. Camera is awesome , though not the best but doesn't disappoint you when you are in low light. Phone is practical and easy to use because of a 3.5 inch screen and small dimensions and like other costly smartphones doesn't require two hands at a time. Very well built body and smooth simple looks,and the apple logo just adds a charm to the back panel. The only problem is memory. As i bought a 16 GB model it though seems to be enough but after around 500 photographs and music you will definitely wish you would have got a bit more. Battery backup is decent. And in just simple words, we get it because it an iphone...

all in all this phone is worth every penny.If u love to love your phone and cant live without it, go for apple, you wont be dissapointed ..."
6753,"I places the order with snap deal a week ago and am happy with my product so far.
It did although power off abruptly once ... But now it's alright.
Good experience overall ."
6754,I am satisfied with this iphone it is quite useful in my job.

6770,excellent
6771,"If you don't have an iPhone, you don't have an iPhone. 
But if you are looking at features, you have alot of options at this price. Apparently no other phone can come close to its stability."
6772,the Name Apple is enough
6773,The product is as per specification.
6774,The apps are much better designed along with the system then any other os...Though a couple of more buttons would not do any harm... :)
6775,Bad
6776,Charger not working...😫
6777,one of the speaker doesn't works
6778,The piece i got is Worst piece and it is refurbished.. lot of features not working properly.. I didn't returned the phone as the return process is too long.... Getting lot of heat... Really Really worst piece.. just don't see the Amazon Brand.. Not sure why Amazon encourage these type of vendors..
6779,awesome phone with really great look and performance....you will love it if you will use it...recieved my order timely through amazon but i haven't got complete bill so i contacted custmer care and after that they mail a scanned copy of it to me...quite satisfied...
6780,"I bought an apple 4s 16gb, but this product is full dusted in USB , headphone, speaker ports...This phone look like a already used phone.& also charger cable was damaged & broken."

6782,it have a very very good camera quality it has siri it is good product from apple inc try it
6783,"I have been using this phone for more than a year and although I am not a big fan of apple products(except for the iPod), I should say this has been a pretty decent phone.Pros:1. Looks/brand name2. Simplicity - Its great if you are someone who doesn't like messing with different settings and just want to use the phone.3. Apps - This is one place where the iPhones blows out any other Android phone in the market. All apps work great and are optimized to work on your iPhone. Every app does what it promises and works pretty much flawlessly4. Speed/Smoothness - This phone has been out for a while and it still runs faster/smoother than most newer phones(Galaxy s3, nexus 4)Cons:1. Battery life - Although people say that it provides a decent battery life, it has been never been the case with me. A couple of hours of casual browsing with 3g drains the battery completely. The battery life is decent on wifi(or without internet) though2. Indoor camera quality isn't that great3. 16 Gb memory/No memory card support - With most apps more than 100 mb in size and some games more than 1 gb in size be prepared to run out of memory soon.4. No true multitasking - Although you can minimize any app and switch to other apps and then switch back, most apps still can't run in the background. So if you are downloading a song or a video and you decide to switch to some other app, the download just pauses.Apart from that what you think about the screen size is pretty subjective. Its comfortable at 3.5"" and you can use this with one hand but at the same time you miss out on the benefits of a bigger screen"
6784,"Excellent product by Apple and no model can beat this beast, Including other models from Apple too till now. No lag and very much User Friendly, Even faster and buttery smooth in iOS 7 than before.I would recommend this product, To whom ever expecting a smartphone in a compact, User friendly and very well in build quality with all features."
6785,I bought it in Aug and within a month it has stopped working. This is the worst product I have ever bought from Amazon.
6786,Awesome
6787,I loved it👍
6788,very good phone and  i am loving it... its the best..better than any phone of samsung...its recommended for everyone to use
6789,I liked 4s better than 5/5s. I had all 3 and preferred 4s because it's compact and has everything which can be used in India.5/5s has more function but can not be used extensively in Inida.
6790,"If you're looking for high speed 4G/LTE feature then 4S doesn't have it being a 30+K price phone one definitely expects it. Samsung Galaxy S3 and above and iPhone 5 are enabled, which are almost in the same price range (just few more K)."
6791,"
PROS

Still the slickest smartphone experience
New camera features are great
CONS

Smaller screen than the competition
Still no Flash support!
KEY FEATURES

The iPhone 4S was never supposed to be. At least not in the eyes of the public, the tech industry and journalists alike. The iPhone 4 had already been out for 17months – a lifetime in the mobile phone sector – reports of iPhone 5 cases and concept designs had been floating around for a while, and surely it was time for Apple to change the stylistic record? Not so. Instead we have an iPhone 4 with everything turned up to 11, or at least 9 anyway.

Check out our video review of the iPhone 4S:

Related: iPhone 7 release date, news and rumours

Contrary to initial reactions from many, though, this shouldn't be cause for lamentation as where it counts the iPhone 4S is up there with the best. However, the list of meaningful hardware differences is rather short. There's a new CPU in the form of the same dual-core A5 CPU as used on the iPad 2 (though it's clocked at 800MHz rather than 1GHz), meanwhile the iPhone 4 has a single core chip running at 1GHz. The A5 chip also packs in seven times the graphics performance of the iPhone 4, according to Apple.

Also new is an 8-megapixel camera with 1080p video recording, a redesigned antennae and the new Siri voice controlled assistant. All of which we'll be looking at in detail throughout this review.


"
6792,So much storage and i can get a lot of apps and games and photos and music and i would recommend spotify
6793,One of the best in the iphone series. Though a bit out dated but still its one of my favorites. Its bezel is just perfect beyond imagination
6794,Apple is apple. It doesn't need any review to define it. I  wish it support volte then i would never change it but now it's my need
6795,The body design is everything. It has my money.  Apple should get this back. It kind of defines the brand. The edge look makes it distinguished from other regular smartphones out there. It definately meet the expectations. And is worth recommending.
6796,Wen I purchased this I had many problems as it was very expensive..almost my one month salary..But later after using it I was assure that full money utlilised deal..it's camera is best..The only draw back was it's battery ..I don't like it's battery..it goes fast that any other Android phones..But u can buy as just one drawback
6797,"It’s my favourite brand, I had this phone and I used to love it and I know I have the higher model. It’s faster and easy to use and I love its features"
6798,"Apple Iphone 4s
apple is the most popular brand in the world.and iphones are most popular among people.As it is user friendly.it has a unique UI . nice build quality .nice specs. nice functions.yes i would reccommend to others .it has its own IOS.
THANKS Iphone"
6799,It's seem so very good .it is a phone for working person mean a busy person that he can handle it very easily . I would personlly like to use this product. It I is a budget product .i would suggest all to have it with you
6800,This has been my phone since 3 years and i cant think of changing it.. it is sooo comfortable to use. everything is perfect!.. it is true- if you don't have an iphone you don't have an iphone
6801,Me encanta mi Apple I phone  lo recomiendo tiene un gran función tira uña foto hermosa me agrada es fácil de manejar tiene una gran capacidad del almacenamiento
6802,"I loved the iPhone 4!!! The design of it is brilliant. Would be nice if I could still use mine, I'm sure someday apple will open up the upgrades needed. Until then I'll be saving my iPhone 4 even collecting more as you can pick one up for next to nothing! I especially would like to get my hands on some of the custom colored iPhone 4's."
6803,"The Apple iPhone 4S was my first iPhone for myself. I loved it. It was easy to use. I could download what I needed to, at the time. The camera worked great and I could save alot of pictures onto the phone. The battery always lasted forever. I never had an issue with it."
6804,I love i phone product they are so different from other phones very unigue ..great size especially for those who don't t like big phones .. very good phones last forever never had a problem ..
6805,"Fantastic technology, Great quality with a host of features dezigned  to make your life easier.  With its itunes library allows the user the ability to select and download music and apps at the touch of a finget. With more apps than any smartphone; this makes this a ssuperio device.  Its award winning camera allows the user to take  instant quality pictures while immediately post yhem to your favorite social media site."
6806,"The iPhone 4S is truly the best phone that I've ever owned. I use my phone for almost everything from groceries to tracking packages. The app store as a great selection of apps, sometimes I'll just search for something to see if there's an app for that and most times there is. My only complaint is battery life, but really the phone does so much that it makes sense for it to get tired often. "
6807,"I have only had it a few weeks and i love it. like i needed a new phone for a while and this phone has been so useful. i have even dropped it a few times and it is so durable. my old phones would have been broke by now.
"
6808,Horrible product. it worked for about half a year. then with the new updates the amount of storage just disappears. i mean it does not add up. you will have no space to update anything unless you reboot the phone. the background refresh seems to be the real problem. i have deleted over two gigs of photos and videos and not less than two hours later its back to no memory left. would not recommend any s phones from apple or any phone form them for the matter. 
6809,The apple iphone 4s was the first phone i ever got. With its very tiny and mobile use i did very much enjoy it at the time.it was very eaasy to use and never really glitched on me till about 1 year of having it. i would recommend as a good starter phone.
6810,"Was an awesome phone, even when I dropped it and the screen shattered it was still kicking on :) Don't use it anymore due to an upgrade! "
6811,"I've had my phone for almost 4 years and it hasn't disappointed me. It wasn't new back then either, but it's been working great. "
6812,"Can't live without my I phone, it's the best device ever , you will love it , if you purchase one, you won't be sorry 

"
6813,"I loved my iphone 4s. I dropped it a few times and eventually the screen shattered. It would be nice if they used shatterproof glass. Also, my lock button jammed, which I heard was common in Apple products. I switched to a galaxy but I miss the easy to use iphone. The camera was great and the screen was bright and clear. "
6814,"I think that the iPhone 4S is a good phone￼. Good features, easy to use and good value for money￼."
6815,"One of my favorites, it doesn't glitch a lot and it works very easily! I would like an iPhone 6 to upgrade but yes I like it very much! It's fast working and awesome! Very reliable for everything and personal objects! Definitely going to be using !"
6816,"I had my iPhone 4S with Verizon and it worked perfectly. I'm not one to update on a regular basis so it was nice that this one lasted for awhile. Toward the end of my contract, the battery started to go and I had to get a new one but the replacement lasted the same amount of time."
6817,"I had this iPhone for work, and it was actually (believe it or not) the first Apple product I had ever used. I can definitely understand the appeal -- the screen looks smooth, it feels sleek and nice to carry, and has a weight to it that actually kind of makes it feel more important (maybe?)... there were some things I didn't like -- the screen was small when compared to comparable android phones, the camera wasn't great at nighttime, and it did break a couple of times and then miraculously recover. overall its a great phone! "
6818,Great iPhone! This was the first iPhone I purchased when I switched from android. Very user friendly and high qualiry
6819,This is a great smartphone.  It runs efficiently and the camera quality is okay.  A con for me is the memory size.
6820,I love My IPhone 4s I've been using IPhone for the last 6 years and I will always use them! They are dependable and I've never experienced and technical problems with IPhones! 
6821,I like this phone is comfortable to carry in my pocket and purse. The  apps are simple to use.
6822,Siri is amazing the phone is good for everything but pictures. 
6823,I've loved my iPhone 4S since the minute I got it. Looking forward to upgrading to the 5 as soon as I can. Having an iPhone is a MUST!
6824,"My first smartphone was an android and I hated it. I was so excited when my cell phone provider finally got iPhones. It's simple to use and has many purposes. For a cell phone it has a good camera, (I never even use my actually camera anymore). The app store has so much more to choose from unlike the android store. I would defiantly recommend this phone to anyone. "
6825,This was my favorite out of all the iphones! The only problem is all of minr cracked.
6826,While being an older phone there isn't much you can do on it any more but talk . If thats all ya need it for it will work out fine and bow you should be able to get this at a good price
6827,Slow didn't let it really wanted an upgrade didn't have a lot of storage space 
6828,Can't go wrong with an Apple iPhone! Easy to use and does everything you need! I love love my iPhone it takes wonderful pictures as well! 
6829,"I love apple, and i think the 4s, was one of the best product that they ever made. I still use it today, and it's amazing that you still can use it, with the new iOS as well."
6830,Oldie but a goodie! It's very reliable and has lasted me four years now! Would defnitely recommend!
6831,"I got the iPhone 4s when the iPhone 5 came out (I know, I'm behind on the times).  After a couple years, I switched to Android but missed my iPhone so much that I switched back!  The only thing is, with all the new updates and applications, my iPhone crashes a lot.  But, I still love it just the same."
6832,I love this phone. I learn something new every day on how to use it. The battery life is wonderful because I'm always tweeting and need to be connected to my family and friends at all time. I love how all my apple products are connected and sync with out me doing anything.
6833,Its just an iphone... its a good one. its a really good size and shape. i only wish the front/ and back glass were stronger.
6834,I had this phone for over 3 years and loved it. Just upgraded it to the 5 and not really liking the kinks it has! I have had the 5 for 3 weeks and ready to just switch it back to my old faithful 4s!!!!
6835,"I owned an iPhone for about a year and a half, I'll admit it could take quite a beating, as i did end up cracking the screen not long before i got rid of it, and it still worked. But the layout of the phone is too basic, i love being able to have the option to customize my phone as I please."
6836,I have this phone and honestly I love it but recently it has started to bug a lot. Other than that I think it's awesome and I recommend it. It costs a lot less than other phones since it's older but I can't see a big difference(:
6837,It's okay. super slow. really thick. I don't like this phone at all and I plan on getting a new one very soon
6838,I like this type mobile more than iphone 6 plus. because it's very Stable and beatuful.
6839,"I've had my 4S now for over two years now and I love it.  I am a huge fan of Apple products specifically because they are so user friendly.  I would like to upgrade one day but this phone is doing so well, still!"
6840,I loved my iPhone 4s literally to death however it lasted for years without a problem and then one software update just killed it. Since then I have switched to Android bit I am still open to going back to Apple.
6841,Mi primer cambio a apple y ya nunca me cambiare amo la marca y me encanta este auque ya es viejo aun sigue con migo y funcionando super bien
6842,Worked wonderfully at first and slowly just started getting crappier and crappier. But it was old so understandable 
6843,A great phone that works wonderfully. I love having all the apps that aren't available for android phones.
6844,"Ive had the white 4s for a few years. my battery life is starting to decrease, i really want to upgrade to the 5c but i cant afford it. ive actually dropped it a few times without the case & theres only a chip missing"
6845,The iPhone 4s was my first cell phone EVER! It's been a great phone & I love it! Will probably NEVER trade! :)
6846,Much easier to navigate than any Android I ever owned. I procrastinated on owning an iPhone due to the fact that everyone I know has broken theirs easily. I've had mine for 6 months and it's still intact. Score.
6847,It's pretty cool but not as good as the new one! I would get any kindof Iphone except the really old ones!!!!
6848,I love love my iphone 4s it have a lot of great apps on the phone plus love the FaceTime my husbend works night so he FaceTime  our daughter at night that way we keep in touch and say good night 
6849,I still have my 4s and I still love it so much. It runs fast and has not died on me. I wish the battery life was better but the camera has good quality. 
6850,"I loved these little guys. I was successfully able to change the front and back screens multipul times on these to, so they saved me a fair bit of cash in the long run. These phones were good during their time but I hated how easy the screens broke on them."
6851,I was late to the Apple game but this phone was my first Apple product and it was a game changer for me. I have upgraded a few times since this phone and will not own another brand phone now. They are definitely expensive but worth every penny. Just make sure to get a good case to protect your investment.
6852,I swear apple is the best phone and tablet brand out there I miss my iPhone its sad that I gave it but i will go back to iphone any day huawei and all the other brands can't compete with iphone
6853,Has been a great phone. Still works after a year plus. It's easy to use great size and i would recommend 
6854,This has lasted us longer than any other iPhone. It was the first one my family had and the only one we had for a while. We did absolutely everything on it. It never got slow or cracked. Was nice to use. Upgrading to the 6 makes it look very small and unbearable though
6855,This is a great product. It is well made. It has a nice clear retina display with vibrant colors. The operating system is pretty fast. The camera works well and is great to have when to take nice quality pictures. My only qualm with it the iphone is its fragility. My backplate cracked really easy after dropped it from a short distance.
6856,"I love my iphone 5c in Pink. So easy to use and carry. I can have all my music at my fingertips and with the icloud, not use up my memory. "
6857,Good phone even though mine is on its last leg. Put a case on it and don't bring it wound water- like a pool or tub
6858,"I currently use the iPhone 4s,  and it's alright. It gets the job done - unfortunately it's extremely slow at times and has a very limited amount of storage. "
6859,I lived my Iphone 4S. It was the perfect size for my pocket. Very user friendly. My favorite part is Facetime. Being able to call my friends in other countries is the best. 
6860,Best phone ever. Better than android. I like the color and the GBs are fine for me.  Great phone!
6861,Gosh this phone seemed like the shizzle for a hot second. What a beast. I have always used an iPhone and have upgraded over time. I love the iOS that Apple uses. I love the features and thoughtful updates as needed. The only complaint that I have about this phone and all Apple phones is that it just doesn't have a good camera. It's like they are literally unable to make an Apple phone and a camera work well together.
6862,"This was the first iPhone I ever owned, and I’ve since owned two more (the 5s and the 6s) And while I thought this was an amazing phone when I first got it, iPhones have come so far since the 4s and I wouldn’t go back to the 4s anytime soon. May not be the latest release, but the iPhone 5s was much more reliable than the 4 or 4s."
6863,Great design and amazing response. It uses simplicity in order to accommodate our day to day needs in an elegant style. With such great design also the features enhance my photographs. The way apps work and the way it responds to your needs is remarkable. 
6864,"I love this phone ,when I am used it ,it so very fast to drain the battery life,,,just only one hour,but iphone 6s its on my wishlist for year "
6865,Good phone works well and does everything that I need a phone to do. Pricey when first bought which is a reason it didn't get. 5 stars
6866,This phone was so small it was hard to hold. Quality in pictures and vidoes wasn't good. This phone was so slow.
6867,The iPhone 4S was my first iPhone and I loved it! It changed my life for the better. Since then Apple have just gone above and beyond with their iPhones and I am so impressed by their ingenuity and dedication to making the best and most user friendly products around!
6868,C’è l’ho avuto molto tempo fa ma e stato uno dei telefoni migliori infatti ho continuato a comprare i telefoni della Apple
6869,De los primeros productos de apple que he comprado me fascinaba muy buen dispositivo muy recomendable definitivamente
6870,"Despite the years that have passed the phone still works very well. Of course, some applications cannot be installed on the device, but the rest is super practical, the photos they take are of good quality for the time that has passed"
6871,Like I said in my previous review of Apple products. We love all Apple phones. All Apple products are made with 100% consumer satisfaction. I will always purchase Apple products. They are built to last.
6872,I have a iPhone 6s plus now but when I had this phone it worked pretty well but the back cracks very very easily 
6873,"I absolutely love apple. i haven't used any other type of phone since i got my first phone. it's expensive but totally worth it. i wish the camera on the 4 was better, but it's not bad whatsoever. so much better than android tbh"
6874,I love this phone it's takes great pictures and the filters are really nice! I also like the new technology of the phone inside it. Also it's very beautiful from the back of the phone. Also I like it and a lot of people in school use it. So its popular 
6875,"For the most part these phones are pretty great. Although, sometimes it will shut out of an app unexpectedly. Also once it shut off and wouldn't come back on with around a 90% battery which was weird. I had to press both the home and power buttons at the same time.  However it works great beyond these small issues. and the app store is really extensive. "
6876,I hated this phone. It constantly malfunctioned. The internet loaded slowly. The camera was awful. Save your money and go with a more expensive phone. 
6877,Great phone but photo quality not as great as the newer phones.  It's smaller size is handy for pocket and bag storage but the smaller screen is a disadvantage for watching videos. 
6878,I had this phone for about 2.5 years and it held up pretty well until I bumped it off the back of a toilet into the actual toilet water.  It still worked pretty well after but the camera light would never turn off so it was time for an upgrade.  It was hard to let go of my 4s.
6879,Like with the 6s i only left this phone behind because of the fact that apple likes to make phones obsolete so that you can upgrade. i had no issues with this phone and actually like the 6s i still own it!
6880,"It was the bees knees in its day. I think i still have mine packed away. Currently own the 11 plus (i know, i know- time for an upgrade)"
6881,"My first IPhone ! Very satisfied with it, I love the design and the double glass back of the phone."
6882,When it first came out I’d rate it 5 stars but I give it 4 stars in comparison to all the newer models that came after. It’s shaped like a thin brick has a sleek look to it and very easy to use.
6883,I love my Apple iPhone I started out with the 4S I’m now at an 11 every two years I get a new one I think the only thing that they could improve on would be the battery the battery isn’t long enough runs down too quickly. ￼
6884,This was my first iPhone and I thought it was the bomb. That was also before my old age started taking my vision lol. The screen was way too small but other than that I think it was the best iPhone ever made when it comes to sturdy case and screen.
6885,Back then when it was new it was so cool to have an iPhone not bad if you have an old one laying around to let the kids play on it
6886,"Aspettavo questo telefono da tanto, confidavo potessero fare un buon lavoro..così non è stato.
Ho avuto Il primo SE, poi ho deciso di cambiare per provare quello che c'era in giro.
Premetto che ora vengo da P20 Pro (telefono fantastico...ma da sempre ne ho sofferto le dimensioni)."
6887,This was my first iPhone. It was reliable and super fast at the time. It did wear down within two years and I had to get a new phone out of necessity
6888,I had this phone for over 7 years and it worked well for the whole way but I got a new phone even thought there was no reason to it was a gift and I would improve the weight
6889,It was my first apple company device I use l love it so much and appreciate it thanks apple
6890,"It was just okay. The battery life was average at the time, the os x didnt slow as the 5c did and it did just the job as a smart phone."
6891,"I had this phone for a few years it done me so well no issues with storage. These phones are overpriced in my opinion. This phone screen colour, apps & battery lasted me very well. The phone still worked but I had to get rid of it as the IOS operating system stopped allowing me to get the up to date apps. And when I called apple they said there was nothing that they nor I could do as the phone was to old a version which was a disappointment. But other than that it done me so well with no issues"
6892,"Before getting the 5s, then the 6s, and now the 7s+ I had this phone. It was my first iPhone and I absolutely loved this phone. It was the perfect size and way more durable than the newer ones. It lasted longer as well the battery did too. If they could only make them this good again."
6893,"One of the first Iphones I ever owned! I absolutely loved the pictures the phone took, but I didnt like how you had to do everything thru the computer! I was used to an android!"
6894,"I had this phone for over 2 years, I dropped it out of a vehicle many times one else with out a case and I got tiny scratches no cracks. It heLs up very well. Only problem was battery life. After about a year the battery dies early at like 30% and even 50%. But other than that it was awesome it just got out dated."
6895,"The beginning of my obsession with apple products! I loved this phone! I could change the phone case cover.  It was the best! 
"
6896,Como todo lo de esta marca es exelente muy bueno es fantastico la cantidad de cosas que tengo y n o se alenta 
6897,"I literally had this phone since 2011 just like everyone else, and even now people still ask if it's a new phone or not. I've dropped it multiple times and have had no damages to it. The iPhone 4s is definitely the most durable and most significant of all the models of the iPhone if you compare it to the grand scale of smart phones out there. The thing that broke my iPhone 4s? All the new iOS updates and upgrades after they stopped manufacturing the phone. If they made phones to last longer like they do in Japan, they would still have business. The battery life is complete crap, my dock is having problems. I've been doing some self manual fixes to it to make it last as much as I can, honestly after I get enough money I am not upgrading to a newer Apple phone. Apple products may be easy to use for the majority of people, but the Apple iPhone has not been on point with any other models of the technology world. My sister has already replaced her iPhone 6 four times. What advantages do the newer upgrades have that other smart phones do not? Sharing texts over wifi? I mean there's a lot of good phones with good camera resolution out there. Apple products can be great products, but there's better out there, but unless your technologically savvy then they're not. I don't know why anyone would want to purchase an iPhone 4s, if you must, go to an iPhone 5 or 5s. Though I've used windows products all my life, i used to be a tech at d&b, so I'm going over to android or a different smart phone brand that has what I'm looking for and is not Apple."
6898,I love apple but the phones are far behind.  People with androids have so many better and more advanced features.  I love my apple phone and don't see myself getting something else I just wish they were a little better.....oh yeah apple get on that battery life!!!
6899,This phone lasted me a good four years. Its durability is unbelievable and I wish I could have kept it longer but the software was so out of date that it would freeze and then crash. Couldn't ever change from apple it allows me the opportunities to link everything I need in life.
6900,Bought this smartphone for my daughter for her birthday. It was very affordable and easy to use. She is really happy with this smartphone and loves the color. Would definitely recommend Apple iPhone 4s
6901,The battery is awful will go from 99 to 32 in three minutes. It will shut off even if it's on 65% the glass on either side breaks easily. Only one speaker works half of the time. The lock buttons as well as the home button both stop work often. In retrospect it is a terrible product. 
6902,"Easy to use, accessible, great default apps while others are just terrible and useless. Millions of apps to be downloaded, volume could be higher. Problems faced with crashing often once a month etc "
6903,I recommend every single apple product ever. Apple can be expensive but it's worth the quality you receive. It has surpassed my expectations. 
6904,"I love this Iphone it's obviously not the best, but it is still good as any other apple device, it may be a bit slower, the camera is slightly worse and it doesn't have all the features the others have. One of the biggest problems are the main button that it is easily dmaged or the battery, but this problems happen in any Iphone it doesn't amtter if it's 4,5 or 6"
6905,"Lo amo, no se traba nada, aun que supongo que esta mejor el iphone 6 jajaja me gusta en blanco se mira muy bien en estetica"
6906,"Love this phone! I never have any issues with Apple ones. The interface of the iPhone is what made me purchase this. I don't think I will use another phone in the future because of how easy it was to use. If you are looking for something simple this is it. Go for it, it's worth it."
6907,When I first got this phone back in the summer of 2014 I loved it. I purchased it already used but nothing was wrong with it. I didn't break it for a whole year and I am rough with my phones. I didn't scratch easily or shatter easily. It worked smoothly and it was fast. Now its spring 2016 and it is going out my speakers are starting to go out my power button is stuck and the front glass is shattered. I'm planning on geting the Iphone SE now.
6908,I love my phone. Its easy to use very accessible for those who have wifi. The computerise Syri helps out a lot all I need is to press one button and shes like my own assistant. This phone is great for staying connected with friends and family. I use it everyday.
6909,Will never use another brand of phone. I love all apple products. The apple phone is very user friendly. 
6910,"This was my first ever iPhone I received as a present. The phone itself is a good size, easy to fit in a pocket or purse (compared to the size of the newest iPhone models). It is clearly not as advanced as the newest iPhone models, but it is a reliable phone that has served me well for several years."
6911,"Worked great until apple's latest os upgrade slowed it to a near halt.  Could have done without the glass back tho, that shattered about two years after I had it. IN A CASE."
6912,"I not longer have this, but the time i had my beautiful cell phone, and spectacular, did not present any NEVER fails, all accessories came in perfect condition, no problem at all, but sorry I had a small accident with my cell phone  and i lost him "
6913,"IPhone's don't seem to be made to last for the long haul, only until a newer comes out.   Glitches with updates, randomly turns off and requires a hard boot. "
6914,Very reliable and good quality. Although it seems to crack easily besides that it's user friendly and great
6915,"It's an old iphone. Cheap, yet still cool so these models make good ""first phones"" for kids. Got a used one for our daughter for $40 and was well worth it. All the iPhone excitement without all the ""iphone"" price tags. "
6916,"Amo este celular,sistema operativo ,camara,tactil,todo es genial,ansiosa por obtener el 6"
6917,I love this phone it lasted a very long time and i never cracked the screen. It runs fast and is super easy to type on
6918,I hated the 4s lol & the 5 but Apple makes decent products. I wouldn't go to another when it comes to phones 
6919,"REally good phone, i personally love apple, but their battery life could last a bit longer."
6920,Small but still cute .I love my brother got for me and i must say its works great. Takes really nice piictures too.
6921,I purchased this phone used. It was in great condition and it was great. This phone is just as good as the newer versions. I recommend it.
6922,I love iPhones they are amazing. If you cans decide what phone to get I'd say Apple.
6923,Like it so much because the size of it .it fit in hall my hand bag and pants pocket and i love apple iPhone because it's easy to use 
6924,"I love the fact that 16GB of memory gives you plenty of storage to download all the apps you want as well to keep a large number of pictures in your phone. Aside from little annoying bugs here and there Iphones are a solid choice for a smartphone. The 4S camera is decent in quality, but the 4S battery life is terrible, so be ready to purchase a case with an extra battery or an external battery that you can carry with you wherever you go. My biggest pet peeve with Apple is that it makes high quality phones that can do almost anything you want, except hold a battery for long enough so you have the chance of taking advantage of all its features. For that reason and the high price tag I never buy the latest models of iPhones and always keep an iPod touch on me so I can listen to all the music and podcasts I want without worrying about being left with a dead phone by lunch time. Another issue I have with iPhones is that the volume of alarms comparing to Android phones is very low, so if you are a heavy sleeper like me be certain that you will need a most reliable alarm to wake you up in the mornings!"
6925,What would I do without my iphone?! What a great device that is so easy to use. I cant leave home without it!
6926,"This was a great phone while I had it. It lasted me much longer than expected. I was well overdue for an upgrade before I finally bit the bullet and got a new one. I don't recommend 16 GB, its barely enough to fit a decent amount of photos and songs. But all together a pretty great phone. "
6927,I really love apple! the company is so great with everything! If you ever have an issue it so easily fixed and these phones last forever !!!
6928,"J'adore apple, j'utilise leurs produits pour l'électronique. Je peux syncroniser mon portable avec mon cellphone"
6929,Never need another phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6930,"I will always be a an apple girl!! The iphone, ipad and the desktops all work seamless and so easy!"
6931,I wish I could afford one of the newer phones. I miss my Nexus 5 to be honest. It's been a good phone though. 
6932,I like it because it's very reliable and lasts at least 4 years I've dropped it so many times and it hasn't broken once.
6933,"Love apple products, needs a upgrade.  Would recommend apple to anyone. Who wants a durable  reliable phone"
6934,"Mehhhh..  Slow but usable. I only had to use this thing while I waited for an upgrade.  It's doable. 
"
6935,Well first thing I have to say about this phone is love how it takes pictures but that's about it 
6936,I loved the phone until about the 7th month when the phone started freezing. The phone is not meant for people would have sweaty palms. 
6937,I love my Iphone even though it's just 4S i love it. Also it still updates but the 3 and 3S does not update so I wouldn't buy it.
6938,"Love the versitality of this phone, no need to carry a PC or iPad along on trips anymore."
6939,"Good phone for the price, but considering that apple has the iphone 6 out already with newly updated operating systems, I would spend the extra one hundred dollars for at least an iPhone 5. The phone is otherwise great."
6940,"I love my iPhone. While most people would be appalled owning an older model, I refuse to upgrade. Aside from faster download speeds I do not see how the newer versions live up to their price. I have had mine for two years with no complaints."
6941,IPhone 5 came and it still hasn't been able to fare as well as its predecessor. If you're new to iphone and want to test it out you should with this first; it's free with a new contract (US phone carriers) and isn't that far behind compared to iphone 5 and you'll be saving money. 
6942,"This phone is amazing, i had the iphone 3 and after getting this i do not regret. amazing phone"
6943,"I've had this for a while now, and it's the type of product that is so amazing, once you own it, you can't imagine life without it. We all know this isn't just a smartphone. Screw everything I know about technology and engineering - this is magic. And I don't hand out positive reviews very frequently, but this just goes above and beyond. My boyfriend has the next gen, but I'm too attached to this one to even consider switching yet."
6944,I had an iphone4 and upgraded to the 5. I have to say there are only a few small differences between the 2. The 5 can take a panoramic picture and the navigation is better but for the price I should have stuck with the 4. I prefer apple over android because its more user friendly.
6945,I think it's overrated and overpriced. Memory is good though but other than that its not out of this world
6946,"I have had it for quite sometime. I have all Apple Products and they are all synced with one another through iCloud. I have access to everything at my finger tips. I can make phone calls, surf the web, listening to music, and a ton of other things. I also love how I have access to Siri. She is like my personal assistant. I couldn't live without my 4S"
6947,Es passt in jede Hosentasche und ist sehr robust. Das display zerkratzt nicht und man kann alle nötigen Apps darauf runterladen
6948,"I loved my phone until the very end. The battery wasn’t doing as great near the end, but she lasted me up until the iPhone 11 Pro was released. She still ran great, but it was time to upgrade - thanks to them not updating my system anymore."
6949,"I loved this phone when I had it!  It was my first I phone, and has sense been replaced, but good memories.  All except for the fact my screen would Crack all the time..."
6950,Loved this phone when I had it! Really good quality and never had any issues with it. I liked the size a lot and the build and shape of it!
6951,"What can I say about Apple?  Oh my gosh, I'm an Apple fanatic!  Each product is perfect, elegant, classic, very well made.  And I'm serious, it is the BEST!  And I want to let you in on a secret, even the Apple credit card is top notch!  Apple simply the best!!!"
6952,"When this design first came out it instantly became one of my favorite generations of the iPhone. Although the software and functionality feels very the same across all iPhones, the look of this was sleek with the squared metallic frame. This phone lasted me a good few years before I upgraded."
6953,At the time this was the best phone ever! Apple has constantly been improving its devices.
6954,My first iPhone! Loved the phone but the screen broke so easily. I shattered mine like twice😅
6955,"The infamous iPhone 4s was my very first time having an iPhone and I was lost on how to use it, but oh how I loved it once I got everything figured out! It was a much smaller phone compared to what I’ve gotten since then but it’s definitely good for someone starting out (granted it’s not made anymore). I definitely would recommend all iPhone products to those who are tech savvy!!"
6956,It a good phone but it is vey old now. It is very small. It cheap now you can buy on eBay.
6957,"One of the most basic iphones from back in the early 2010s, the phone itself was pretty inovative for its time. The screen was nice and apple music was nice but it required you to install the program to your pc then download the songs to it. Now that I look back, we are definitely spoiled by the technology we have today."
6958,"This was a very great phone. However, only down side now is that the phones software is so out of date it’s practically useless and only good for parts. Love Apple, but I dislike that we can make use of one phone for a lot longer than a few years."
6959,"The best phone I have ever had in my life, its camera, its size, it was the best, and of course beautiful, and not because it is Apple, really, the best phone that Apple has released"
6960,It’s been years since I’ve owned one of these. I believe it was my very first iPhone. It was cool at the time and I loved it but I probably wouldn’t recommend this phone at this current time.
6961,My first iPhone. iPhones just work right out of the box. No tweaking needed to do what you need done. Expandable memory would be great though.
6962,Great product that gets the job done. It is easy to break the screen though so get a cover ba warning to d they only have a 2 year loan GE span and then they will start glitching and will need some tlc. But it’s phones are the way to go for me. Supported by an albertan🇨🇦
6963,I swear by iPhones after changing to them years ago I’ve had quite a few different ones and always go back to them lol they’re simple to use and I love the fact that everything backs up so easily x
6964,When it first came out it was a great little phone. But small in size. Very reliable. Durable yes.
6965,"My first ever iPhone. It shattered easier than any iPhone I’ve seen, well other than the bendy 6 plus that followed a few years after. There are plenty newer ones that at this point are free, go for those."
6966,I really like the iPhone 4 because  in  intermediate the only phone I had was at iPhone 4 and it help me get through things and it was really helpful and I still have a now
6967,I absolutely loved this phone when I had it. I think the glass casing was the best feature.
6968,"Was a great phone until the forced obsoletion issue of the past.  Phone sat in a hot tub for several hours without a case and worked great, after a 24 hour drying period. Simple to use and pick up.  A little small for my hands but great for my wife's smaller hands."
6969,My first APPLE’s phone. Great phone at that time had good photo quality. Miss its charger it was big bulky one. But its battery was not that long lasting. I had to switch the phone i think about few months.
6970,"Es un buen teléfono, sin embargo es bastante pequeño y fácil de perder de vista. Algo pesado. En cuanto a su sistema operativo tiene gran parte de las funciones de los dispositivos Iphone. Buena calidad de imagen, aunque ya ha quedado atrás en comparación con las nuevas versiones."
6971,"My first cell phone was an IPhone 4S and I loved it too much, but as time went by it got damaged and now seeing this incredible model of cell phone I was fascinated with the perfection with which they create this kind of phenomenal artifacts, I love the Apple company every time  creating and inventing new things for the public.
Apple - iPhone 11 Pro with 64GB Memory Cell Phone (Unlocked) - Gold"
6972,"Loveeee thiss, iphone es mi vida, quien no lo tenga, pues lo debe de tener,  solo digo esooo, wowww, compra lo ya a q esperas"
6973,"Este fue mi primer iPhone y la verdad me gusto mucho por que lo supe usar muy fácil, a parte era muy pequeño"
6974,I had this little guy as my first smartphone. Had it up u til I upgraded to the 6s plus years ago. Worked great just was time to upgrade and get these newer phone. Love iPhone very simple and easy to use. I have the 12 now
6975,"well i don’t have anything to tell about this, it was a really good cellphone in 2014?"
6976,"esta muy bueno... al ser un poco viejo no tiene una velocidad extravagante, pero según el tiempo de creación, bastante bien.. me gusta bastante para cuando tenes un celular muy grande, entonces llevas ese que tiene un tamaño disimulado, y es menos probable que vivas un robo. en conclusión... un 8/10 "
6977,"Fue mi primer iPhone y puedo decir que me gustó. Tiene un sistema operativo que, en ese momento, era súper rápido y la calidad era muy buena. A pesar del tiempo, aún lo tengo y funciona bien, lo único es que se calienta después de un rato."
6978,"This was my first phone and it lasted a really long time , I think I got it back in 2014 😂 well it got really slow in time and the screen is incredibly small compared to now a days"
6979,I got one of this from my uncle and it has been 4 years using that phone.It has some problem and the home button won't  work so I bought a new phone in 2019 till now.
6980,I have a song for so long. I don’t have anymore but this was my first iPhone and it was amazing. I never had problems with it I just simply upgraded. Always kept a protector on it so it didn’t crack or get messed up. Overall good phone
6981,"This phone was horrible for me, I ran out of space and wasn’t allowed to take pictures of anything, but that was years ago. I’m sure nobody uses this dinosaur phone anymore."
6982,"The size of the IPhone 4 is perfect.  I love how it fits in the palm of my hand and how quickly I can get from one screen to other screens.  I’ve had several generations of IPhones and this is by far my fav.  

I really wish that they had skilled enough techs to fix older versions like this one.  And hope that they bring this phone back..
Photo quality is still great and it’s an awesome back up phone."
6983,It is a good phone. The only issue I have is all the constant nagging for updates. I don’t like that one bit.
6984,"It was first iphone and i was a really good phone when i get but this model had a really bad wifi antenna, it suddenly stop working by it self and it cause that the phone spends all of his battery searching for a wifi connection even if the wifi was enabled, damaging the battery that was one of it better aspect. 
I will not have this phone even if someone give it to me for free"
6985,"Ganhei dos meus pais, ele tem ótima qualidade, tem tamanho ótimo, não trava muito, e a qualidade das fotos são ótimas"
6986,It was alright for the time I had it til the home button got jammed but other than that it did the job
6987,My very fist iPhone. I loved it! Easy to use. Also my other back up phone but not used at the moment.
6988,"ME ENCANTA!!!! Yo soy una chica muy fanatica a la tecnologia, muhas horas de mi vida las paso usando artefactos electronicos, y pues me regalaron un iphone S4 y pues..... ES UNA MARAVILLA!!! LO AME POR COMPLETO! es un celular practico y facil de usar. Mi bateria uffff me dura pos horas e incluso dias y no tengo ninguna complicacion con el sistema operativo!.  EN CONCLUSION LO RECOMIENDO COMPRAR! "
6989,Its a FRAUD. I purchased this phone back in 2014 thinking its new. When I received the phone the camera was not working properly. I first went to apple store and they said that phone was not new and it was bought in 2011 so it was out of warranty. After the phone was replaced the replaced phone had scratches on its screen and the body of the phone. I could make out that it was a REFURBISHED phone. Because i had bought this phone for my DAD who lives in Venezuela and he was leaving the next day. I had no option but to keep the phone. But I want to aware everyone who plan to buy this product. Please BEWARE that you are buying a REFURBISHED phone.
6990,"Okay, first of all, I've had this phone for about 3 years and its great. It's not as fast as the new phones, and definitely not as thin, but I like it because it actually feels like I'm holding something sturdy. It still is getting software updates and is working great despite its age. Highly recommend to everybody! Don't think judge a book by its cover!"
6991,"
It is an honor for me to deal with this siteAnd the oldest review of this phone very good very much and many followers like this phone, of course, because it is a new brand did not download the markets fully, I look for such new products to be known by everyoneThis is a new opportunity to tell them this wonderful site and I would like to work with you and thank you"
6992,"This Iphone Is The Best Model In Iphone FamillyAnd I Want To Review This For My Friends And tell Him About How Good it is
"
6993,"From my personal experience, I think that the iPhone 4s is one of the coolest phones that Apple has manufactured. It is characterized by its solidity, protection and high efficiency without forgetting the quality of the camera is one of the coolest phones I have.
"
6994,My uncle gave me this as a present last year. The battery is draining so fast idk why. The front cam is not so good. There are times when it blacks out but its fully charged and sometimes when i just lock my phone it will never turn on again. I'm still using this phone until now and i'm planning to buy a new phone because this is really not my style.
6995,"I love this, the memory is awesome. The picture is awesome it is easy to use and very small. Which is the best. I hate big bulky phones"
6996,"I had the iphone 4s and the truth is that it is very good phone, I do not regret but thanks to the very good technology of the apple they could make advances and came out on iphone 5 I could advance to that and I say that the 4s left me very good Moment!!!"
6997,My sister have this phone by his time it was really good and affordable now that we have all those greater phone still good but not greater good and i recommend this one for those who can afford the expensive ones.
6998,Con tansolo tener uno de los tantos que hay de Iphone seria un sueño echo realidad aunque ahora tenga un telefono comun y corriente espero llegar a tener esta plataforma y chatear en facebook estar en instagram disfrutar en twitter llamar a mis padres hablar con amigos por whatsapp hasta tarde
6999,This was my first ever iPhone. I have absolutely no complaints about this phone. It lasted me the longest time and I loved it. I only updated my phone back then because there was a really good deal to get the iPhone 5S!
7000,Good battery life I use it as a iPod because I got a new phone and it can still send Imessages even without service but you must have a WiFi connection
7001,I had the apple iPhone 4s and I have to say I did like the size of it much better than the iPhone 6. I like how it was much smaller and easier to handle. Yes by now I have gotten use to the size of the 6 but I still would much rather have the size of the iPhone 4 but with the features of the iPhone 6s 
7002,"I'm not happy at all with this device, because I used it this for 3 months because I broke my 5s. It's was horrible, the ""wifi"" button kept turn off and the only way to turn back on is , might sound crazy but I had to use a blow dryer till heat up and see the alert that it's over heated then put in the grid for 10-20 mins then hope for a miracle that wifi button turn back on "
7003,"
Old but effective. I have been around for 6 years with him and it goes exactly like the first day. For me this brand is the best without a doubt.I'd love to try the 7 * - *"
7004,quisiera que estos productos lleguen a mis manos para poder hacerles promocion y tengan mas seguidores para sus productos
7005,"Alguien sabe si depronto estos productos como teléfonos celulares se. Pueden obtener gratis o algo así ? 
Someone know if I can get a free iPhone for example like a voxbox ?"
7006,"es un producto genial el cual me gustaría dar a conocer a mi gran variedad de amigos para que pruebe sus servicios en esta pagina 
quisiera que me lo mandaran "
7007,Relativamente este celular es muy bueno su tamaño es indicado y a mi opinión es mucho mejor que no sea tan delgado
7008,"Perfecto, es muy facil de usar, es practico y compacto. Ademas de que es bastante comodo, es rapido y las aplicaciones  son muy divertidas, el interfaz es sencillo y entendible."
7009,"I had it from 2012 like everyone else because it was the most popular phone. It was worth the money, it had good rear camera, good resolution 3.5'' screen and many other features. The thing I didn't like about this phone was its processor, even for a 2011~2012 phone it was bad. Although back in 2012 it was worth the money, even just for the camera !"
7010,I've had the iPhone 4s since 2015 and It lasted me a very very long amount of time! It still works beautiful and I'm curious to know how long it lasts me in 2017! apple products are simply amazing. You definitely get a lot what you pay for. 
7011,I remember when I had this phone compared to the iPhone 5 it is a lot bigger and I feel more updated
7012,"Ótimo produto. Tenho ele faz anos e é maravilhoso. Bonito, fácil de usar e não é um  tipo de celular frágil. "
7013,"The iPhone 4s was an amazing phone. In my opinion, it was the best iphone for its time. The recent iphones have not added a ton of new functionality, and they have become less durable and tougher to repair. If you crack your screen on the newer models, a replacement screen is much more expensive and it is extremely difficult to repair, almost forcing you to go to an apple store. Back in the good old days, you could buy a replacement screen for less than $15 and replace it yourself in 10 minutes. It is also pretty durable - I had an otterbox on it which cracked and broke long before the phone showed any sign of damage. The only real complaint I have about the phone is that it is slow and has trouble keeping up with today's software. This is an unfortunate problem in the computer industry in general, not really a problem with the phone. When hardware gets older and is forced to run software designed for top-of-the-line machines, the older computer can't keep up that well :(. I just retired my iPhone 4S, but we had a good run and i'm exited to see what the modern phones have to offer. I anticipate that it is not anything groundbreaking, but just faster and more powerful components and a few new bells and whistles. I hope my new phone will last as long as my 4S did!"
7014,"Es un buen teléfono, tiene muy buenas funciones y una cámara de muy buena calidad. La verdad sí cumplió con mis expectativas  "
7015,This was my very first iPhone and I loved it so much! Great apps and system! 
7016,Excellent cell phone at the time the resolution of the camera is brutal and the space to store my photos and music is incredible. I agree with my mobile nothing of complaints in this regard
7017,"Great phone but it is outdated and will remain outdated, You have to have the 5 to get the updates now, I wouldn't get the 4 unless I absolutely had to! "
7018,"A wonderful phone, but with the newer versions coming out it is clear that this could be better. I love the new addition of Siri on this phone. There is a clear distinction between the 4 and the 4s. This phone could be worth buying right now because it is so old so it doesn't have the amazing new features that the other phones have but it is still very reliable. Very soon, if it hasn't happened already, you will not be able to download many apps because it will require the new iOS. So definitely keep that in mind when considering purchasing this from someone. "
7019,Es el teléfono que tengo en el momento! La verdad no puedo decir muchos comentarios malos sobre este celular! Es muy bueno ya la verda resiste como ningún otro! Jaja! Se me acaba de caer y esta vez sí se rompió! También lo que me gusta es que sus refacciones son muy baratas! Y si para lo común y normal si sirve
7020,"MY CELLPHONE. It is my actual CELLPHONE and I like It but now the system is a little slow, I would like to change for another better but I dont have the money hahaha. Finally is a good cellphone and I love it. "
7021,"I have had my iphone 4s for over three years and it is still going strong!  I have dropped it multiple times and it still looks great. The battery life still lats a while (except when I am running my step counter app!) and it charges at a good rate. I have no major problems with this phone, except that is has gotten somewhat slow and I am running out of storage space. I also wish I could buy new cases for it in the store. :) I will probably upgrade at some point but I am so thankful that my 4s has gotten me this far and has worked so well! "
7022,This is one of the best phones by my choice i do reccomend this because it is very usefullit lasts long the space is great because u can get many apps
7023,Loved this phone.  I'm a bit of a snob and always wait for the S version to come out before upgrading my iPhone. I've never been disappointed. Great budget phone if you're a little short on cash. Performs well with the new updates. Only downside is the smaller screen size.
7024,"this phone is excellent I love a lot 100% recommend is a great phone. Iphone is the great brand of cellular imposing among all market.
"
7025,Eu quero purfavor manda pra mim purfavor não tenho celular a minha vo não que minha da 
7026,"I used my iPhone 4s for 2 years. I didn't like how the back was glass as I dropped it ALOT. It was really good for the time, but I wouldn't own one now. "
7027,I loved my 4s till after 1.5 years the battery started to go and the phone just kept freeing BUT the camera was great. 
7028,"Hasta ahora ha cumplido la mayoría de mis expectativas. No queda pegado, las aplicaciones funcionan correctamente. 
TIP: para unas buenas selfies busca un lugar con una muy buena iluminación. 
¿Desventajas? 
La batería se acaban muy rápido, si se cae es más que seguro que se parta la pantalla, SE CALIENTA de una manera extraordinaria 
(TIP 2: puedes utilizar esto a tu favor para cuando tengas dolores de vientre), cuando se calienta mucho las aplicaciones se cierran solas. 
Es muy buen teléfono y a pesar de todo, yo lo recomiendo."
7029,"Mi telefono anterior fue un iphone 4s de 16 gb.
El uso que le daba a este era infinito.
Tanto para redes sociales, jugar, estyudiar, leer, trabajar, la paginas del banco, pagar cuentas, los correos, la universidad y es un excelente equipo. Después de 2 o 3 años la bateria falló, es por eso que lo tuve que cambiar.
A comparacion de Android se puede ir actualizando las versiones de IOS y eso te permite siempre poder descargar cualquier tipo de APP y disfrutar de las actualizaciones del sistema.
Es un modelo (respecto al tamaño) muy favorable para mujeres."
7030,Eu quero muito um iphone  6s ou 4 e meu maior sonho ter um iphone apple e um grande sonho amo 
7031,"I liked the dual-core processor and to have only 8-megapixel camera, it does take stunning, clear images."
7032,This was my favorite of the Iphone series and it still wasn't that great.  I hated the set up and the fact that the screens busted so easy.  It just seemed as if it was another way for apple to take more of your money.  I wouldn't ever recommend this phone to anyone.  
7033,My all time favorite version of the iPhone. It's durable and a smaller in size. The apps are great. 
7034,I got to own a iphone and i like it but yet in my point of view it jusf like an iphode but on this one you can cal and use a gps on it 
7035,"
There is no better screen or resolution or size , and developments are to be found inside the phone. The design is also the same . You just have to been an increase in weight of three grams.

The move to a dual core is the most important in terms of processing capacity of the new iPhone 4S . With the new Apple A5 ( dual core) processor, apple company places its new phone at the height potential of the most advanced Android this year. Increasing RAM, but it has not been given the figure is expected to be 1 GB."
7036,"This phone was great at first, but it is getting old and is hard to use these days. Camera is outdated and subpar. "
7037,After purchasing this as my first iPhone I don't think I'll ever switch to a brand other than Apple. Their products are so well designed with so many features and they last for quite a while. I would definitely recommend iPhone to others
7038,Very small. And super slow when i first got it way back when it first came out. Not impressed.
7039,"My absolute favorite phone to this day! When I still had it I was not gentle with it at all since I was a total clutz and he screen did not crack once! One time I accidentally had thrown it 10 feet across a room and it still didn't crack (which amazes me to this day.) even though I upgraded to a 6 because it was getting slow, I still recommend this phone highly for its durability!"
7040,"First iPhone I ever purchased and has been my favorite! Had it for years, until my husband bought me the 6, and didn't want to let go of my 4s. It was a big change I did like the iPhone 6, but the screen shattered so quick, and my 4s was in perfect condition after dropping it so many times. This has to be my fave iPhone, still miss it. "
7041,Having an iPhone 4s in 2016 work absolutely well had the same iOS updates like the iPhone 5 but the only thing my iPhone 4s couldn't do was the snap chat filters other than that facetiming was easy and going live on Facebook worked. Everything was until my old Bestfriend dropped my book bag and broke my phone 😭😭 the only iPhone I ever had
7042,I enjoyed it! Never had any issues while using it. It was always fast and the battery life was very good. 
7043,"I loved it back when I first bought it, two years ago, but with so much usage it started getting slower and almost never accepts any downloads I try to do. If I were you I'd choose another brand or another cellphone higher than this one. It can even be an Iphone still."
7044,It is good but my had broken on the floor and I will love to get a new one but I don't have the money for it and it is not going good for me and I don't have a ride to go out with my friends and I can't call no one else I am on my computer now and again thank you very much for your time.
7045,"This is my current phone, due to be replaced most likely this year. I have had this phone since it's release date and it has served me well over the past almost 5 years. The only thing that I hated about it was that there was a slight noise when on a call and it has been that way since day one. It has had several OS updates and has slowed down significantly but works well to be a 5 year old phone. I enjoy the way things flow with apple so I would recommend iphones to everyone who likes them. I love the games and apps made for iPhone more than I do the ones on my Android or windows  devices."
7046,Too small for my taste.. But it gets the job done.. Would recommend for people who are lookibg for something more simple
7047,I still have my 4s and I still love it so much. It runs fast and has not died on me. I wish the battery life was better but the camera has good quality.
7048,"I have to say I currently own the iPhone 6 64mb and I have 3 cracks in the screen. All kinds of scratches on the body of it. 
Aluminum. Go figure. 
I had the iPhone 4s for 5 years not a single crack in the screen no scratches. 
But I just had to sell it and get the newest one out there. 
Goes to show that it's not always best to have the newest stuff out there. "
7049,"This is probably my favorite version of the iPhone. It's durable, small, and quite powerful. I like the thickness of it, there's no bending, and you can fit it in your front pockets. "
7050,This was my first IPhone ever and it was my favorite until the 6 came out. I bought me and my mom one.
7051,This was my first iPhone ever. I loved it so much. It was the perfect size. Now I just can't see myself without my 6s.
7052,Loved my iPhone 4s. it was one of the few phones that I can truly say lasted me a while. Also loved that even after the screen is cracked it is still functional. 
7053,I've always been a fan of apple products. I got the Apple iPhone 4s when it first came out. I actually still have it and use it. Been told to upgrade but why? This one works perfectly well and still looks brand new. I have nothing negative to say about this phone. I will continue to use it till it gives out. Will I ever upgrade? Sure I will. Will it be anytime soon? Probably not. 
7054,I've been strictly an Android user but I  decided to change things up and got my first iPhone which was an iPhone 4s. Had it now for over a year... Had many chances to upgrade to newer model but I am used to it now works great ....
7055,"This was a great iphone!! it was very good funtional and little

I use it all the time, I even still use it sometimes "
7056,This phone was okay for the time that I had it but I was not impressed with the picture quality.
7057,"I had this phone before buying the Apple IPhone 5. It worked well, but as the newer version came out I realized what I didn't like about this phone. It is thicker and weighs more than the new ones. The screen is smaller which could be a pro or con. Overall an okey phone."
7058,"It obviously was great in the time thata was the new one but right now i have an 6s and my mom still has the 4s and i used and it's sooooooo sloooowww and crash every 5 minutes i don't now, i think they make them and if they are going to sale a new one they make tha last one sloww and I functional so you have to buy they're new one i don't really know i think it's how apple works but in the time that it was new it was great 🙃"
7059,"My first Apple product, I love my cell, easy to use, Great for everything. I never had any problems with it."
7060,Both of my kids have this phine and it keeps them entertained . They haven't asked for a new one and it hasn't broken like I've seen countless othera do so I believe its a good phone for them.  The only thing is that since its an older version you can't get updates. 
7061,"Great phone the photos are fantastic the Hd screen is very vivid bright and easy to see, it's was an experience product but worth every penny, I love my iPhone and I would recommend everyone to buy one."
7062,Apples iphones are very dependable there's a reason I phones have been number one for so long
7063," Apple computers Apple iPhone 4s 16 GB Verizon wireless  Is too hard to use and has a super slow function. The best feature is that it is small and easy to fit in your pockets. With the other Apple products being out there, I definitely will not recommend this to anyone."
7064,"As any Apple products it is great!!!
We have been using Apple since 2007 and will not change any soon "
7065,"I think I have had mine for 4 years, and I has been the best phone i ever had, never any problems, so I think it was worth the money. i thsa been relaible, but now it has started to be a bit slow, so I have ordered a newer version Iphone, and I hope it will be as good"
7066,"Ok phone but needs a bit of work because I was not 
I love this its great really recommend it and you should get it it leaves my skin feeling soft and nourished!
"
7067,"One of the best iPhones I had! and I had them all (ashamed)
I had zero issues with my device,smooth and extremely reliable device. The iPhone 4's camera was the first good camera in a phone I'd genuinely tell you to buy. Of course, iPhones have improved since!"
7068,I love iphone I'm an iphone user but because of 8GB memory it keep crashing every time not all updates are available and the price was a little bit high 
7069,I really don't like this phone. It's way too small on really really really slow. The only reason why I got it was because it was really cheap. Oh well let me update it.  I've been saving up for the 6S for a while but I don't have enough money I really need that phone
7070,"This phone is alright. I hate that the glass cracks easily. and that I keep having problems with the Apple ID. and I hate getting the same notifications about things that I don't care about, I hate you apple but I can't stop buying your products!"
7071,Can no longer be updated so why keep it? Pretty useless at this point in life so we upgraded to a 5 and 6 and love those. This is easy to use although you can't play updated games or anything updated which kinda sucks. They improved with the newer phones
7072,I love my iPhone. It is great to be able to use imessage when there is no service like while traveling. I do think that more storage space would be nice but i think it has been my most reliable phone so far. 
7073,I had this phone for 4 years. This phone is super strong for the many times that it slipped out of my hands not once did it crack.
7074,"This device is what I currently use and it seems to be an okay phone. I like the size of it and the fact that it is not bulky. But as more iPhones come out, my service gets slower and slower. "
7075,"People still buy the iPhone 4S? 

I had to go back to the 4S after my phone jumped out of my pocket while out for a run. A few points: 

- the camera is notably worse than the 5 and other newer models. 
- 16GB is a remarkably small amount of space if you keep photos or music on your phone. 
- it is not compatible with newer versions of iOS, so it's slow and many apps currently available on the app store are not compatible with iOS 7. 

If you're looking at the 4S because you're hoping to get an older smartphone on the cheap, I'd steer toward Android options, particularly if you value a good camera. "
7076,"I love this phone. This phone has lasted me a long time (all the way up until the iPhone 6 was released!). It did run a little bit shaky with all the recent iOS updates. I finally did decide to upgrade only because I wanted the larger screen, better camera, and smoothr running the newer iPhones offered. "
7077,I had this phone about 2 years ago and I use to love it so much. It was great. 
7078,"Es el mejor celular del mundo! me encanta! no lo dejo de usar ni un minuto al dia, me encanta!! es lo mejor y es muy economico"
7079,I currently use an iPhone 4s. It is OK. Not great. I feel like it is slow and the options for apps is limited. The screen resolution is just OK and I feel like it doesn't take the greatest pictures. I love Apple brand and love Iphones but I feel this particular one isn't the best. 
7080,"I used to have this one, and I still use it as an iPod. I love the size now a days phone are biiiig omg I changed it because there's a point when you can't update the software so it start running slow. But it's a great phone just like everything at Apple I just love the brand "
7081,"I made the switch from a Samsung Galaxy Note Edge and I'm much more happy with the iPHONE. I feel that it's more sleek and feels much more durable than a samsung, which feels almost cheap and plastic. It did take some getting used to, but in the end the iPhone is easy to use and has a lot of cool features like live photos."
7082,I love this phone needed more space so I upgraded to a 6s plus on accident. But this phone is easy to use and good for the price. Be sure to get a good case or Insurance because they are expensive to fix 
7083,In love with this baby!! lo tengo desde hace 4 años y es extremadamente fiel. nunca me ha fallado
7084,"Great product. Very clear images, good for pictures. Best feature is the quality of the resolution on the screen. Screen is small though, and phone itself is heavier than newer models. Getting more memory for a phone is always better."
7085,"It was good when it first released, but now, what, 6 years later? It's becoming a brick. It's glitchy, the battery dies rapidly and switching between apps with the latest software either causes the app to crash to home screen, or it slows down considerably... I don't want to invest more money into it, nor do I desire to do so. It's becoming a horrible little brick."
7086,"Me gusta mucho es fácil de usar se pueden descargar muchas aplicaciones buenas, es caro pero es bueno, su diseño es atractivo."
7087,The heat Apple iPhone I've ever owned... Although the back glass broke fast it was the most durable I've owned. 
7088,I had a 4s. That was a great phone. It is still working for my husband. I haven't had any trouble with the phone. 
7089,"Honestly, we can't say much in this section since the Verizon and AT&T handsets are so much alike. There are a couple cosmetic differences, which we'll discuss, but Verizon's iPhone bears all the familiar Apple-style trademarks. It's the same size and weight (4.5 inches tall by 2.3 inches wide by 0.37 inch deep; 4.8 ounces), it has nearly identical external features, and you'll find that gorgeous Retina Display. We're still not fans of the sharp edges and glass back, but there's no denying that the iPhone 4 remains an eye-catching device."
7090,"This is my second iPhone, the IPhone 6s rose gold. 
It's very reliable but they need some make some changes .
The best is the 3D Touch ."
7091,"I love this phone. When I saw it in the Verizon store I knew I had to have it! Easy to use with a nice design. The camera takes great photos, enabling me to catch shots I would normally miss. Impressive. Excellent sound quality. I'm sure there is room for improvement, such as an even better camera, possibly having the ability to make notes with a stylus ,""pen,"" but for me, this is perfect!!"
7092,I like how easy thus phone is to use. The camera is better than my android and it seems to be a faster phone. Even though this is an older model it did get the job done in a sufficient time. I like how clear the screen Is and how light weight the device is. 
7093,"I use to love this phone, never fail me, I change my phone for an iPhone 6 because i want a bigger screen. But this phone, Is still amazing compare to other brands and models"
7094,"I will never ever use this phone again. The camera was no good, and the battery life literally doesn't even exist. If you drip this phone without a case, you're pretty much screwed. I recommend going with an android instead."
7095,"I put my electronics through a lot. Given that, this phone has held in there and lived up to the challenges I've put it through. My only complaint is that there isn't more memory available. It's super easy to use though. I would definitely recommend it to others!"
7096,This was great when I hadn't however with all the IOS updates it fills the memory quickly. I also found the battery didn't last long. I hear it is a defect with this model.
7097,"Was a good phone. Once memory was full, it run really slow. But it made me fall in love with Apple products and I will never change from Apple!!!"
7098,I've always had iPhones and glad that recently I upped the memory on my latest from Sprint. Don't worry about the insurance unless you are worried about losing your phone. You can get great service at Apple stores.
7099,I used to have this phone and it was great while it lasted! I keep it as my backup phone now if anything happens to the phone I'm using now. I love the color of the phone which mine is white. The size of the phone was also perfect because it was tiny and I don't really like big bulky phones. The design was very simple and chic. I love the glass for the back. The only problem was that there was not enough memory space and it did tend to start getting slower as the new updates came out! 
7100,"I loved my 4s it seemed to last a long time until they started making crazy update, then it hardly worked. It was a indestructible phone also! If I had to i would go back to an iPhone 4s but I also love my iPhone 6s. They sure have came a long way with phones. But it was one of the most indescribable phones I had "
7101,I love my apple products. I've been using apple for years because it is so simple to use. I like the style and it runs smoothr than my android products
7102,Loved the 4 it was my first iPhone. Had the first Samsung Galaxy 1 and it froze on me. I liked the apps and the size of the phone. I exchanged with someone on Craig's list 
7103,"This phone lasted me three years without any issues. It ran well, held its charge and had a great camera. I only got rid of it because I upgraded to a newer model."
7104,"I loved this phone so much. What I loved most about it was its size. It was the perfect pocket size, especially for women. The only thing I didn't like was the amount of space 16gb is too small for someone who would use more than like 10 apps and have some music. "
7105,"Was a great a phone, only downside is that the USB cord was extremely cheap. It broke constantly and I was always stuck buying a new one. I feel it's extremely pricey because we're just paying for the Apple name. I do really enjoy this phone and I would recommend it to others."
7106,"The product that converted me to Apple. I'm never going back! These phones just can't be beat for the quality and consistency of apps, the video and audio quality, and the images. They're pricey but worth it. "
7107,Loved my 4 when I had it. Loved when I upgrade to a 6plus also. I love apple products because they are simple yet have so many great features for my busy life
7108,Id choose apple over any other products but with the iPhone 4 it doesn't have good camera quality but they're easy to use
7109,I used my 4s for 4 years ' I have never had a phone to last me that long ! Usually my phones are acting up before the 2 year window! I will not use another brand! Apple products are just amazing ! I wild HIGHLY recommend this to everyone! 
7110,Waste of money now since there are so many updates it will eventually slow down and i just recommend staying up to date with any apple product 
7111,"Love my iPhone, when I need a new phone will definitely repurchase an iPhone.  Even though my phone is an older model, it covers all I need and is very easy to use and connect anywhere."
7112,This iPhone doesn't really work well. I was very disappointed with Apple because it was very expensive and not worth the money. It is not reliable and will close out of search window. I don't recommed this product.
7113,"I have this phone but i have the 16s rose gold and i upgraded froma andriod so its a dramatic change for me but the IPhone is pretty cool and it has cool features and its totally different from an andriod. its not affordable unless your paying partial payments.

"
7114,Always had a apple device iPod iPhone I love my iPhone I have the iPhone 6 Plus in gold 
7115,"I love this iPhone I really like the back but if u don't get a case 
and drop it to much it will most likely break on the other hand it 
is a really good first phone cause it's really easy to use 
really fun to play with. There is some room for improvement."
7116,"This lasted me four years. Even though it did become slow, I did enjoy it and it did the job well. The best feature would probably be how tiny it was. It was expensive for me since I have a different plan. This was very easy to use and they give you a lot of tips. "
7117,"We haven't had an iPhone 4 in awhile.... It's a good phone... As iPhones are. 
iPhone best feature ... They are easy to use! However the pricey data plans our ridiculous!!!! Also they are fragile... Buy a very good case the same time you buy the phone or you will be sorry!!! Lol"
7118,MY favorite phone OMG.. If you don't have a iphone its time to come into the modern age. its one of my favorite things I have ever owned.
7119,"It worked pretty well, but I did not like the camera as much as I like the phone I have now which is an Android."
7120,I've used it I loved it when I got it witch was when it was brand new and just came out 
7121,"This was the last phone I had . It has awesome features, the camera is amazing, and the 16gb can hold so much stuff"
7122,"I re brought this phone as I dropped it in water, I love everything about it from the app store and its affordable and they are constanly updating the phone so you don't feel like your missing out so everything is kept up to date.. good value for money "
7123,This was a great phone the entire time I had it. Anything Apple is worth the money!! 
7124,"This was my first apple product and then I became hooked. So hooked that I bought an IMac computer and I loved how well they synched together. It was easy to use, easy to get my music on there and I just love it"
7125,"The phone is great; not so much the verizon service. excited to upgrade to the latest version to get the new features, especially the live pictures."
7126,"I love apple products so much, ive been wanting a 5s latelh but everyone keeps ripping me off, the best fearure is being able to change the text size and the vamera takes pretty alright pictures! I would defiently buy another apple product but when i get moneu"
7127,Apple phones are amazing. Great for everything. Simple and are compatible with tons of electronics. Cheap and great!!!
7128,"It's an iPhone, what can you say?  I nursed this baby for a month shy of four years before she finally gave up the ghost.  The battery does start to die quickly after a year or so, and I needed to use an external battery pack.  But all of the amazing things you can do with an iPhone make it worth it.  "
7129,"This phone crashes and is slow a lot. but if you're looking for a quick phone, than this is the one for you. "
7130,This phone was great. Perfect size. One day all of a sudden quit working. They did not make this product anymore so I had to get iPhone 6 got the plus and hate how big it is. 
7131,"I love this phone. I hate the size of the 6. I love that it fits in my pocket. My only complaint is battery life and that on every iPhone I've had, the top left corner of the screen has come loose. "
7132,"I got the iPhone 4s back in 2012 . And at the time I loved everything about it the size , the different things the phone would let you do . I ♥️ the variety of apps and the camera was nice . The price was up there but at the time so worth it . "
7133,"I loved my 4S! I had it for 4 years and probably would have kept the phone if I had just gotten a replacement battery installed. I had to switch carriers from Verizon to AT&T due to cell coverage in my area of Texas. If not for that I would still have my smaller, beloved phone! "
7134,"I had this phone for 4 years! It was amazing ! All apple products I've purchased have been wonderful! I upgraded to the iPhone 6 because I wanted something new, the phone is still being used by my friend! "
7135,I had no complaints about my 4s. The only reason I got rid of it was b/c I wanted the 5c now I thinking to upgrade to an 6s. Forever them #iphone.
7136,I loved having my iPhone 4s. It was my first experience with an iPhone. I think it was a great start. I have been hooked since. I now own a iPhone 6 Plus 
7137,"Works very well, one complaint i have is i find it will lag sometimes! I don't know how to fix it and it gets very frustrating!! I got a good deal on mine however so doesn't bother me too bad! I was hoping for a bit better but still does the job! My biggest complaints is it turning off if it gets too cold (even when it's not that cold!) and it lagging for what seems like no reason!!"
7138,"Apple knows how to make a smartphone.  Easy to use, and even though it seems as if it costs more, the value far outweighs the initial cost.  VERY easy to use, always works when you need it, never drops calls, and I highly recommend it to anyone needing a smartphone."
7139,The iPhone is great and it has wonderful features but the battery life is it's downfall. The battery does not last long at all and you have to charge if often and the sound seems to go off sometimes. Reception is also not as good as it used to be. I am experiencing more dropped or lost calls 
7140,My white iphone 4s has lasted a lot longer than i was expecting haha It was very affordable only $50 after the 5 came out. No limitations i can think of  
7141,"It's a sturdy, good phone. Apple products are always easy to use and they are as multifunctional as it gets. It is a bit pricey, but I do feel like you really do get what you paid for. It's a quality product and will retain its value in the future, even if it is an investment"
7142,"I use to have this phone and was extremely slow, terrible image quality, sound was quiet "
7143,"I just got rid of my 4S. I had it for four years. It never failed me and worked amazing, I never needed a new phone. Yes, it was my first Apple product and it made me a huge fan. It was reliable until the last few months. I always tell people to get apple if they're looking for a new product. "
7144,My iPhone 4S lasted me the longest out of all the iPhone's I've had. I'm now on my iPhone 6s and truly don't foresee it lasting at long as my 4 did. I still use my iPhone 4s as an iPod and for using other apps. 
7145,"A big fan of apple cellphones. Love the 4s its look is very sleek. The app store has to be my favorite part, the app collection is amazing. Also apple is constantly updating the software to smooth out glitches. The phone is easy to use no complicated features, just a great sleek phone."
7146,Love my Apple iPhone.  It does everything.  From keeping my daily schedule and setting reminders.  I listen to all my favorite music and am able to stream my favorite movies and TV shows. There is nothing this phone can't do.  Easy to use and fast.  And looks nice while I am doing it too!  
7147,"Seeing as this phone is such an old model, it functions very poorly and the operating systems are not very well compatible with the phone. Not to mention, the camera quality is not good AT ALL. Aside from that and some other technical developments that Apple has made since the release of this phone, the 4s works. It's a good starter phone and it can use internet, call and text. It's an acceptable phone."
7148,"This phone turned me into a iPhone for life fan!!  I can't even remember what life was like before my iPhone, well maybe I don't want to remember because the pictures were terrible and now thanks to this phone I don't even need to drag around my bulky camera anymore. LOVE LOVE LOVE"
7149,I loved having the 4s! It was a great size for smaller hands and the camera worked well! It's easy to use like most Apple products. It's worth the price. It's a little outdated now.
7150,"The iPhone 4s with 8GB is preety good for its functions, but it's a little slow. It works perfectly and I had no problems with it. About selling it, is pretty hard, because there are newest kinds of iPhones, but I'm pretty happy with my smartphone right now, I recommend it!"
7151,This phone was great until other iphones came out. If I were you I would buy the newest iphone because this one is going obsolete 
7152,"I love apple products. The ability for them to work with the laptop, iPad, etc it awesome. They are expensive. Icould is the best. Virus protection. They are super easy to use. User friendly. Improve on the pricing. I love apple we have a laptop and tablet and etc."
7153,"This phone was great when I used it, took great pictures and never lagged, however the battery life was not great on it."
7154,Great phone. Does seem to have a few clitches though and can freeze up from time to time. 
7155,I actually purchased the black color for my husband. It was his first smart phone and the best feature about this brand of phone is how easy it is to learn. It's definitely reliable as it has never crashed. There is always room for improvement but it was a great decision for my husband.
7156,"Although this phone was great, I couldn't wait till the next generation model to be released. It's comfortable to handle with its slightly rounded edges"
7157,"Great phone, small size, decent camera. I would recommend this for anyone who likes a smaller device. Great for people who don't want all the newer features on the latest iPhones."
7158,Amazing camera quality! love this phone so much! It is so sleek and easy to use. I have been a die hard apple fan since college and I haven't stopped. 
7159,I love iPhones and apple products. However I need more data! I'm also scared to update my phone because I've heard horror stories about phones that have stopped working after an update.  All in all its a great phone though and it allows me to do pretty much everything I want. 
7160,"I really loved my iPhone 4s! It never gave me a problem a quick restart couldn't fix. I had ton of space for me and was easy to  navigate through, and a great quality camera. I've used iPhones since they first came out but really liked the iPhone 4 ."
7161,"Loved my 4s, however when it's time to upgrade it's time to upgrade!!

The 4s was by far the best iPhone I have owned.  The battery life was amazing and I liked the size way better than the 5 or 6.  However, I didn't like how thick it was. "
7162,Love apple products but the battery life wasn't great and there wasn't enough space for things on phone. 
7163,I purchased the apple Iphone 4s from a friend. I do love Apple Products. It is very easy to use and very simple to figure out. It wasn't very expensive. The best feature of this product is the space and how user friendly it is. I would recommend this product to others. 
7164,"I am an apple addict. I love the flexibility that an unlocked phone affords me as I travel quite frequently. I wish the higher gb phones were more affordable as I do find 16 does not allow storage for the amount of stuff I keep on my phone. However, the addition of iCloud helps With this problem. "
7165,"Apple is a company that is here to stay. He secured his place in the technological environment and is always ahead of any company in the industry. Your own operating system in the phone offers unique features and open spaces allowed for developers worldwide. It is an expensive but essential product in modern worlds. Although I have problems with the battery, it is something worth investing even a little more"
7166,"This phone is still up to date and has plenty of great features just like the newer models. It's a reliable phone that lasted me three years, the only issue is that they crack so easily! The back of mine smashed with a simple drop. That being said, the simple user interface makes it well worth it."
7167,"Granted this phone is a little bit older, but I thought I would put my two cents in! I had an iPhone 4s a while back, but recently had to reuse it because I dropped my phone in the toilet- basically it's completely outdated now. It's small and is very slow compared to the newer models. What I will say, and the reason I gave it two stars, it's like a brick. Very thick and not very easy to crack! Which is good in today's time! I also want to add that the battery life is basically a few hours, tops. In my opinion, don't get it in 2016. "
7168,Very nice phone as compared to the others available. Has a lot of nice features and apps to choose from. I like the new camera they added takes wonderful pictures. Phone is easy to navigate and use. Would recommend this to anyone interested in trying an iPhone for the first time 
7169,"This phone was great for its time! I was so sad to get rid of it. It was durable, given that it was mostly made of glass! I really liked its size, it was perfect for your hand! Unfortunately towards the end of its life it started working slowly and freezing a lot, but I suppose the pitchers of beer it got dropped in didn't help 😏"
7170,I had an iPhone 4s as my last phone it was a good phone I never had any problems with it at all it meet all my expectations it was very easy to use and small enough for my pocket I love Siri I used it all the time I would recommend trying out this phone if u haven't.
7171,"Love my new 6s way better, to small and I'm hoping now to get the 6s+. It's easy to use tjo"
7172,I love the iPhone 4s because it has good applications for music & games it also takes good pics & videos also holds a lot of music too & it has good cases for the iPhones I also love the iPad mini I own 1 
7173,"I am not a fan. It seems Apple is in the habit of forcing consumers to upgrade their phones. This could be, because they push out so much new stuff. However, they stop supporting the systems these phones use and then many apps become unusable.."
7174,Very durable nice smartphone. The 6s is a much better upgrade. The 4s lasted 2 years for me. 
7175,"Great phone and great featured, I have been using this phone to upload most if my YouTube video and I will said try iPhone I'd u don't have money to get a DSLR camera "
7176,The phone is great it's very helpful to me especially when I exercise it tracks how many steps I take every day
7177,"The phone was great at first, quick dependable and great battery life. The downside was once I hit a year old the phone was slowing down and started to run out of room. The battery would have to constantly be charged and never held a charge for very long."
7178,"Had this phone for several years and had virtually no problems. However, like most iPhones, I did end up cracking the screen but that was my fault for dropping it. It was a great size. No issues with the software and I would recommend to others,"
7179,"Do they even sale this phone anymore? I'm not sure but this was the first i-Phone I ever bought and it was definitely worth it and made me want to be an i-Phone person. It's just like any other i-Phone, easy to use and awesome. I don't know if they sale it anymore though in stores as they have the i-Phone 6s+ now haha but it was a great first i-Phone."
7180,It's a great phone just really outdated.  It can't handle the software updates anymore and is super slow if you have multiple applications going at the same time.  This phone is probably fine for someone that doesn't use social media much on their phone but for me it's just way too slow
7181,"IPhones are the best, but I would update it every year because they are meant to die out. still can't live without it. "
7182,My iPhone is old trusty. I made a switch to Samsung and the software malfunctioned within 6 months of ownership! Back to the original iPhone I go!
7183,I really love the iPhone 4S BUT for some reason my wifi didn't work! It was completely frozen gray and I read other people's reviews complaining about the same thing. It was the perfect size and all. Even durable for an iPhone but the wifi not working did it for me because paying for data is too expensive. 
7184,I bought this second hand phone off eBay and I absolutely love it. It is so easy to use and it has all the features that I want on it. It didn't cost me very much as it was second hand but has made me wasn't to buy a new one next time I need a new phone. I would definitely recommend it to my friends. 
7185,Love the apple products. I've had apple phones for 5 years now and no problems with any of them. I've dropped a few times and they still worked. If your new to apple it does take a little bit to learn but easy compared to other brands. Apple Is always coming up with new ways to improve the next phone. They are on top of the technology 
7186,"I have had mine since it first came out. I don't use it anymore, but it's pretty awesome that I still have it and it's still functional. I used it again last summer when my 5s fell in the toilet. It worked just as fast as the new iPhones and took great pictures too. "
7187,"Happy with my iPhone although I gotta say, 16GB is not nearly enough these days for the iOS + some apps + photos or media. I hold zero music files on my phone purely due to space limitations and am constantly needing to delete my photos. Zero videos.  "
7188,Well....I've always been a Samsung gal.....Guess I'll continue to be. IPhone is just not for me.
7189,This phone was my very first iphone! It was my go to! It definitely was good to me until after the years it started not working as fast but that is the usual phones always stop working after a few years! i really have no bad complaints about this phone! I loved it!
7190,Sleek/Refined look. Very easy to use because of simplicity! Great colors to chose from
7191,"I had this phone before I got my new iPhone 6 and it was the best phone around at the time, it was fast, kept a lot of storage. it was quite pricey but every phone is. the camera is really nice but it does crack very easily. I would recommend getting an iPhone 6 at this point because it's faster and has more features "
7192,"Great phone overall. Absolutely loved it and its features! Love that it also comes in white. Price point was good, could be mildly expensive for some. Operates smoothly."
7193,"I loved this phone. This phone made having a phone a great experience. It has all the features of the newer phones now and it works fine. It's pretty small and cute and worth the buy, especially unlocked. Pick up this phone as a beginner phone for a teenager! "
7194,"I am in love for all apple products, my iphone is very good, meets all my needs and desires.. never had problems, it is very easy to use"
7195,There's not much to be said about this product. Does anyone buy any other brand of phone these days ?
7196,I had this phone and upgraded to a 6s never had a problem with it. My daughter now has this phon
7197,Good phone froze up every once in a while. Which is usual for cells phones anyways. Will only own a apple. 
7198,While this phone is old its a great phone for someone who doesn't need to do that much. It has enough storage. 
7199,"Good with the topic of the capacity of memory of the equipment not and had problems. Peo with the topic of update if and many, One of them is that it gives the orders me to update applications and when I update it mistake goes out for me or is hung and I cannot open applications up to after 2 hours, Also the topic of the chamber is delayed in focusing or the photos with the flash in the night work out very yellow, with the topic of the system, I am hung And aveces it is restarted, initially it was not happening to myself but an hour I have it mas followed."
7200,"The best telephone ever, I don't think I would change to another brand, for me is just the best device ever created. "
7201,"Was good for the first couple years, however, now it's super slow and laggy. It literally takes 10 seconds for an app to load. However, all functions are still working, just the lock button on the top broke three years in. Luckily there is an accessibility function so the lock button isn't completely necessary!"
7202,"Fue mi primer telefono y sin duda alguna me lamento de haberlo vendido, supero por mucho mis expectativas, es super facil de usar, se adapta a cualquier persona y es muy bueno su sistema me parece el mejor, lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados para quienes quieran comenzar a usar apple"
7203,"I use to have this phone awhile ago. It was awesome because I just love all Apple products but the only problem I had was that it kept crashing on me , and I needed to upgrade my phone because the screen became black and wouldn't work. "
7204,I always go with an iphone because  I'm so used to it. The phone is pretty good I find it can be slow and that the battery does die significantly faster then my old one. But it has more storage and I needed that. The new phone pricing is a little ridiculous you pay monthly for the phone and it ends up costing a lot by the end of the contract bit I guess you can get upgrades earlier then before. 
7205,It was okay! Can't complain didn't have much trouble. Screen cracked.  It was pretty affordable. It met some of my expectations. I don't like how you can't surf the web and be on the phone at the same time. There's lot of room for improvement for sure. 
7206,BAD QUALITY IS REALLY BAD WONT RECOMEND TO  ANYONE IT DID NOT MEET MY EXPECTATION AT ALL WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY IT IS AFFORDABLE BUT I DON'T LIKE THE STYLE AT ALL BEST FEATURE WOULD BE NOTHING IT TO CHUNKY YES THEY SHOULD IMPROVE THE CAMERA QUALITY 
7207,"I was hesitant at first to get on the Apple bandwagon. When I finally tried their Smart Phone I was sold. I had it for 3 years because I didn't want to upgrade. Then it started have problems. I was so mad I used my upgrade for a Samsung Galaxy. OMG! What a mistake THAT was!! After a few months I couldn't take it anymore. I called my provider and ended up paying $800 to buy the phone so I could switch to the iPhone 6! That Samsung was junk. The trade in value at one of those vending kiosks
Is $36!!!! WHATTTTT?? I'm sorry Apple, I'll never betray you again!! "
7208,"I love this phone 
It's fast smart and the apps are great not to mention the cases you can get are cool too I love this product. "
7209,This was my first iPhone and it lasted me forever! I still have it (over three years old) and keep in case anything happens to my 6s
7210,"I have the iphone 4 at 8GB, but i love how reliable it's been and I wouldn't change it for anything. The space is just my concern, but I have everything saved and backed up on my macbook. My favorite feature is the alarm clock, I can get up for work (both....willingly and unwillingly)"
7211,Worked great for the 1st year but quickly started slowing down and the battery started dying daily. 
7212,Love my new phone. I use it all the time. I was thinking of getting a galaxy but I use my FaceTime to talk with family and friends. Love be all the new things I can do with this phone. 
7213,"I was verry happy with my phone, but my batery died verry fast, i really loved the way to use it, it was verry easy to use"
7214,Few months ago I had this iPhone 4S and I thought it was a good one the battery lasted for days it had great applications in it and it was simple and easy to use the best feature is the camera and siri it was very useful
7215,"The iPhone 4s was my first iPhone and i loved it. Now that I look back, it was very small... but at the moment, that was what everyone wanted. Like most iPhones, they are easy to use and get great phones in general. A lot of improvement as been made in the last phones "
7216,"Love my iPhone. Its easy to use, simple, the picture quality is great. I don't know what I would do without my iPhone. I listen to podcasts, easily access my email, and FaceTime with my Mom. I also don't think the price point was too bad. Excited to recommend."
7217,"The iPhone 4S is available in black or white and with three different amounts of internal memory. The $199 model comes with 16GB of internal memory; for $299 you get 32GB of internal memory; and the 64GB model costs $399. All these prices are contingent on signing a two-year cell phone contract with AT&T, Verizon, or Sprint. Apple also sells “unlocked” versions of the phone that aren’t tied to a specific cell phone carrier for an additional $450 (for a total of $649 – $849 dollars per phone)."
7218,"The iPhone 4s provided countless hours of playing crunch candy. When the candy says sweet and TASTY then I know I have accomplished great things. It has also provided many hours of talking to my stinky kid, and INSTAGRAMMING. Siri is a wealth of knowledge. none of my friends are smarter than siri."
7219,This was my first smart phone and I don't regret it ample has one of the best touch screens and that's great
7220,I think iPhone 4s's are almost indestructible. I have dropped mine countless times and no shatter! The battery could be better. 
7221,Very sleek phone always works well. Takes good picture it's very easy to use. Very little problems with apple products. Fairly inexpensive 
7222,I use the iphone 4S right now! I'm in love with my phone you can do everything ofcourse with a smartphone. An iphone 4S is the best phone you can have it works so smooth and the phone is so beautiful of course the iphone 4S has just 16GB and you cant use the new updates of ios and the effects of snapchat 😕
7223,"I have used this phone and have always used iPhone, I love them all. This is a great phone."
7224,Its a good phone but don't plan on it working for too long. it gets really slow as soon as any storage is used. it has glitches often. doesn't have many features. its frustrating  having to pay for every song you want on the phone. its better for youger teens as a first kind of phone that you don't expect to last long.
7225,I switched from a blackberry to an iPhone and I absolutely love it! It's so easy to use and I can sync it easily to my iPad and Mac!
7226,"I loved the 4s, but most companies have stopped making applications that are compatible so it is a lot of money for a phone that apps may or may not work on."
7227,"I've had an iPhone 4s literally since my junior year of high school, which would now be 5 years ago (wow time flies). I've seen my friends go through all the Apple phones, from the 4s to the 6 plus, and I have to say that although my phone is starting to get extremely slow to the point that it's making me want to just switch completely, it is the most durable of all the iPhones. I have never in my life cracked my screen, and I am a very clumsy person; I've dropped my phone numerous times throughout the past 5 years, and not once has it cracked. It has had some issues when I drop it that you can't hear someone when they call you unless you put it on speaker, but that problem has typically resolved itself (it's happened a couple of times). The one complaint I have about this phone is that the camera is the worst quality ever, so if you're into taking pictures you should probably invest in a good camera or a more modern iPhone. The pictures always come out grainy and lack a lot of color when you take pictures in the daytime or outdoors. They just will never look good. Another complaint I have is that my phone has gotten extremely slow when it comes to opening and loading apps. It'll take me a good minute to open up Facebook or for Instagram to load its feed, which is frustrating. Definitely will be upgrading soon, but the one thing I'll miss is the durability of this phone. Nothing compares."
7228,"Decent phone, but crap when it comes to memory - there is no memory expansion and 16GB fills UP fast. Unless memory can be added this will be the last time. "
7229,"This was a great phone for me.  It allowed me to join the modern world with all the popular apps.  It met all expectations and was reasonably priced.  It would have been perfect with a better camera, but it does the trick as is.  Great as a starter smart phone if you don't have to have a lot of storage space or the newest features.  "
7230,This was my very first iPhone and I loved it! At the time it was a great product and very durable. 
7231,"Best phone I've ever had! When I switched from android to Apple, it was the best decision I ever made. At this rate with all of the new technology, I won't have much need for a laptop. It has everything I need for my day to day lifestyle. Switch if you haven't already! "
7232,I loved this phone way more than my current 5C. The 5c really sucks. The 4S I dropped almost daily for 4 years before it shattered!
7233,"Very good I can do a lotg on this device and it is very fun just to play on if you are bored or you could watch YouTube
"
7234,I wish l never left apple it was so easy to use and user friendly with definitely Wil buy again 
7235,"This phone was my first smartphone ever and I had it for two years before giving it to my brother who still uses it today. I felt it was durable, great investment for a smartphone. I was very happy I chose an iPhone as my first smartphone,since I was scared of breaking it! "
7236,Even though the phone is a few years old it still works great for what needs to be done... Easy to use... Nice size...
7237,It's a nice phone but it's software isn't up to date so it's slow and gets annoying at times. 
7238,Love love love this phone! cant imagine having anything other than apple! i have no complaints on this phone 
7239,"This is the best phone i everhad in my life, i would buy another one if i lost it cause it is just THE PHONE i promisse"
7240,Great reliable phone! Charges well and I have no complaints other than it won't update to the newest IOS. I personally bought it for a reasonable price and can play simple apps on it without any issues. More so a phone for someone who wants to simply call or text!
7241,"I enjoy this iPhone. However as a mother I take hundreds of photos a day it seems life. 16 GB is just not enough for me. Next time I want to purchase a 32 or 64 GB IPhone. Other than that I like it, it takes good photos and uploads them to FB quickly which I also do a hundred time a day. lol"
7242,I'm not really an iPhone fan. my first and only iPhone was a 4s and it completely had a mind of its own . it kind of scared me and I only had it for 3 months . it kept recording my conversations and randomly repeated only things I had said that day . Its never happened to anyone else I knew with an iPhone lol makes me feel crazy
7243,I loved my apple iPhone 4s I had the 64g with Att service and had it till I upgraded to the iPhone 6s 128g 
7244,"This is my cell and I love it, although I would like one with more advanced technology because I do not get updates certain applications and can not install programs that need more advanced IOS. The design is excellent: good size and elegant color. It has good graphics and withstands falls. "
7245,"Great phone. Loved the size and style of this particular version, however, if you are looking for a great camera and editing options, I would go with one of the newer versions."
7246,I love the iPhone feature that allows me to track my whole family! We will stick with Apple as long as they stay affordable!
7247,I have this phone for a backup for my Lg stylo! And it is actually working better than I thought it would
7248,"I love Apple and always have. This is a 4s (I have a different one now) and I loved it. I found it very user friendly, lightweight,durable, and it had a great design. I honestly used my phone more than my tablet or computer. My only complaint is they really need to make phone shatter proof and water proof. I would also prefer a removable battery."
7249,"It is so amazing 

This phone is revolutionary and fast it is old but works so good you never notice I still use mine and plan to keep using it "
7250,This was the first iphone i ever purchased it held up for a good while i believe it would still work today if i would not have upgraded its a great product anfd simple to use 10 out of 10 
7251,"I love my iPhone! It has a great camera, beautiful display and I've dropped it multiple times and it's survived the entire year with no scratches or cracks. Personally I hate that I can't download free music but that's my only complaint. "
7252,"I actually really enjoy using apple products. They are pretty simple and easy to get a hang of. I had the iPhone 4s a few months ago. Sadly the phone screen broke which is one of the main problems I have with iPhones, (even though I should have put a case on it; which I didn't). It withstood me dropping it in the toilet twice and didn't have many technical difficulties. The earphone jack broke and I'm not sure how but I've had that phone for 2 years before any of the problems mentioned occurred, so I'm guessing it was time for me to get an upgrade anyways. I still have an apple phone and enjoy their products. They're very modern."
7253,"LOVE my iPhone!  After traveling and using a cheapo phone you can only imagine how thrilled I was to get this back.  It has tons of apps including 
a great camera!   I wi.l only buy Apple phones in the future (unless the government gets free reign to access it!)
Ned is a "
7254,"This Phone i will always will keep it is so different from all the new phones around, i got it for a very good deal and plan it is so reliable to use, lots of storage for use and  i love siri! the best features of this phone is the camera i love how it grabs your eye."
7255,I feel that the Apple 4s is a really good phone but the  more updated ones are better. If you want a first phone this is perfect for you!
7256,I absolutely love my iPhone 4S. I plan on upgrading in the next month and will continue to use apple products.
7257,"The phone has always been a good working phone, up until recently I haven't been able to download certain apps due to my phone being too old, but that's just because of Apple."
7258,I have this phone only issue is that it is now 3 years old and the system is started to show its age it is running slow and is hard to use and it keeps shutting the  programs or apps i am on down after a certain amount of time however for the first two years it was running perfectly and was a really great phone
7259,Love my apple products!! They last forever and don't have glitches. I use my phone frequently so it's important to have a great brand. I do wish they came with more iCloud memory. 
7260,"I had an iPhone 4s for about 2-3 years. It worked like a charm but as newer iPhones came out and newer updates were installed, the phone slowed down and the battery life didn't last as long. I recently purchased the iPhone SE because the size and price were ideal. All the feature work perfectly. Apple products are the way to go 👍🏻"
7261,"As a previous android user, I thought the switch to Apple was going to be hard. But it's user friendly system was easy for me to pick up. I love that everything can be personalized. It's expensive to purchase, but I haven't had to pay extra to maintain it. Though, as the updates get more advanced, my phone does seem slower. "
7262,After a while I had to change my phone which really frustrated me. This phone did not work well with any of the other new apple upgrades. However i really liked that my phone had the siri function and I still do. i wish that apple would have kept their products this size because it was perfect to fit in my pockets when working out. 
7263,"
In love with this phone without doubt , a good camera, good speed , meets all needs for social networks, the super recommend this brand is the best track to follow him always get excellent products to market"
7264,I think it's the best phone Apple has invented I dropped it millions of times never broke or cracked 
7265,"It was wonderful, nothing was glitching. I barely had cracks so it was easy to not break it. The color i got was black and it matched all my cases. I really like how everything is east to get to. The besr feature would have to be siri. You can evey modify her to a man. This phone was great, still is, but i got an update."
7266,"The battery runs off almost instantly! You have to carry your charger with you so you can't be uncommunicated, sadly my expectations went down with this product, maybe because it's an old version but I thought that It would be nice to try, I guess I have to save money to buy the newest one."
7267,Love this item! Apple has some pretty amazing products and some pretty amazing add ons. Its quite expensive but it is worth every penny. I got it from a local radio shack. It very user friendly and very esy to use. THey need to make the keyboard buttons bigger!
7268,The only issue I have ever had with Apple is the slowing down after installing iOS updates. I like the simplicity of Apple for everyday use yet it's very easy to utilize the device for higher level tasks.
7269,This phone is a typical original from Apple. It is basically the same thing as the iPhone 4 but has Siri now
7270,The iPhone 4s is still to this day my favorite. It has withstood years of abuse from me and my 5 year old. Holds up very well. 
7271,I have the iPhone 5 very happy with the screen aize . My expectations of this love is met when I can take it and put in my pocket . I am not able to do that with the iPhone 6. I have felt this phone is better built then any other phone out there. 
7272,I had this phone for four years and it was still standing . It made it through all of my high school years which is a Amazing cuz I can not tell you how many times I have dropped it . It never stopped working and was extremely functional 
7273,"The memory runs out very quick. The sizes of th phone I like. However the memory is a problem since it can finish very quick. Also, the phone's software crashes often and it's not a year since I bought the phone. I won't recommend except if you're on a tight budget and need a temporary phone. Outside of that the usual Apple features are awesome! Love the keyboard and the apps set up which is easy to manipulate. "
7274,"Un telefono suoer rapido , una camara buenisima, mucha memoria , rapido , bastante practico "
7275,I loved this phone it was a very cool phone and i am getting the 6. it is very easy to use if you work with phones. it is reliable but it does break easily. i just hate that updates like every once in a while. i recommend it to people that like iphones
7276,I purchase an Iphone about every 5 years or sooner if the new product is amazing.  I have found that the Apple Iphone is much easier to use than the other brands.  It is the right size and very durable.  I have not experienced any problems and would recommend it.
7277,"My iphone was awesome. i Loved it and used it for years, but after about 2 years the battery life died. I was always carrying around a charger. BUT until then I loved it and never had any problems with it. I would love to have another apple."
7278,I went with the 4s because we couldn't afford the 6 at the time. I love how easy iPhones are to use with all the apps right on the front screen. The 4s was inexpensive by comparison but not as useful because it doesn't update to the latest OS. I would recommend others go ahead and purchase the 5s or 6 or the latest SE.
7279,"3.5in Retina (960 x 640) LCD display
8 megapixel camera with 1080p video
Dual core A5 processor
Dual antennae for better signal
Same chassis design as iPhone 4
"
7280, This phone is still in excellent working condition and the battery life is still great. I have since moved up to a newer version but I have kept this phone as a back up and for my son to use. 
7281,"Apple is so easy to use, the one problem I found after a while is that it didn't hold its charge as well as it used to but that was after a couple years use"
7282,Super small. Quality for the camera is horrible compared to the new phones and sometimes slow but that could be the company. 
7283,"For someone who just needs the basic apps and features for a smartphone, this is perfect. I had this phone for less than a year, but over a few months, it become extremely slow, the microphone feature didn't work properly (it actually stopped working properly in a very short period), it would freeze, and also shut down apps whenever I would use them. I ended up selling it and getting a more upgraded iPhone."
7284,This phone work great the battery last long. I just wish that I could download more stuff to it 
7285,One of my favorite iPhone models. It has a great camera and so many great features. I haven't had many complications with this phone. It is very durable and strong.
7286,This was the first smartphone I ever had and I loved it it did everything it was supposed to 
7287,At first I thought that this was going to be a great phone. It was reliable at first until the battery started giving trouble and the power button stopped working. It somewhat met my expectations and it was easy to use but their is plenty of room for improvement.
7288,Apple you could've done better! This product was really good before a 5 came out ! 😂 But this is a really good phone for a child that you want a phone for so you know they are protected and the hard part about Apple is when a new phone comes out you can't find cases anymore for that phone!
7289,I loved this phone when it came out. After two years of use it did start to get a little slow. Also 16 gb is not enough space!
7290,"A fairly old phone, but still running strong, despite a fair amount of abuse.  Software is very easy to use, and it still handles web surfing, social media, and e-mail like a champ.  It's a bit sluggish and doesn't have great battery life in its old age, but if it died today I'd still be happy with its purchase."
7291,"Great phone for its time, but not all carriers are compatible with the new software updates, causing apps to not work, and has a slow processor compared to the newer models. Good for a child but kinda useless for an adult in 2016. Get a newer model"
7292,I like my phone and it defiitely has stood the test of time.  The only thing that i hate about it is the small screen.  Its hard to use the 4s for business purposes. It also loses memory a lot.  
7293,The iPhone 4s was great until the newer iOS updates began. The phone went slower and began getting hot after a few minutes of usage. It was nice having my music at my finger tips as well as movies. The other thing the irked my nerves is the fact that I couldn't update unless I was on wifi and even when you're connected you better pray that the connection isn't interrupted or you're screwed.
7294,Need a new phone but i.e. had iPhones since the iPhone 3 and I have had pretty much each model 
7295,"This phone has been great! I have had for 3 years and it's still going strong with the exception of the power button no longer working but I'm able to continue use. I originally had android phones and with this being my first Apple phone, I will never go back. I would add a picture but I am using the phone to type this review. :)"
7296,I have had an iphone since the iphone 4s and ever since then I have not gone to any other brand. I love the quality of the software and the look and feel of their phones are very classy and high quality!
7297,Great phone! I'm using it right now however it's starting to slow down a little so I think it may be time to upgrade to a newer version of the iPhone soon!
7298,"For me this phone is like a little computer I can do many thing  with it, wheni buy it, I thought it looks so  normal  this was a little expensive 
but it is a good investment."
7299,Love how small the phone is. It fits in your back pocket without sticking out much😊
7300,Having a smartphone like iPhone that comes with a lot of application is good. it is a little bit pricey but its worth it in the end. because you may enjoy the app. i was a little bit sad because when i download a app it causes to slow my phone. yes i would recommend this to my friends and family.
7301,"I had one of these about a year ago, now i have A 5c. Apple is great at first and easy to use. But for some reason my phone always decides to stop working and theres always something wrong! Its probably my carrier for the most part but sometimes its apple. "
7302,Great deisgn and quality. Easy to use and many functions to do that other companies might not have.
7303,"Apple is really known for their electronic gadgets/devices.It is so reliable. The features are easy to use. The screen is easy to touch (unlike others that needs hard touch over time). Even though sometimes it crashes or malfunctions when a little amount of water enters the home button, when properly taken care of, It is worth the buy."
7304,"It still hold up like it needs too, although the updates aren't like the updates for the iPhone 5/5s or 6/6s"
7305,This phone is amazing. I have been using this for almost 5 years now and the phone still work pretty well. The camera quality is decent. The phone gets kinda slow after a long time using.
7306,The battery life on this phone is ridiculously awful. I've switched between three of these phones this year and they all die very quickly.
7307,"This is a phone that I have loved having as my first smartphone. It is easy to use and still has a good battery live for being so old. I love how compatible it is with my Mac. Even though was an expensive phone, it is definitely worth because of its durability."
7308,I hate my phone simply because now it is considered old and dated. just wish in had a newer model with a nicer camera.
7309,Bought this phone for my son. He loves it. Wish there was a way to expand the memory on this phone as he finds hes always getting low on memory to be able to download apps or to update. But overall its a good fit for him. I would recommend this phone to others 
7310,Love it! still using it 4 years later and going strong! The new software does make it a bit slower but it still works generally well for me because I can still call and text. meets my needs and its a great size or me (i don't like the big phones.)
7311,Wasn't my favorite and you couldn't do much with this phone. now a days you need the most up to date phones to get around!
7312,I love my apple. My apple can do what most phones can't. My phone is easy to use and if you get lost you can ask Siri anything. I love how I can lock my phone with my thumbprint and how my phone will lock after so many password attempts. I love that i am able to access my phone from any computer. 
7313,"These gadgets have an incredible durability and are the easiest of managing and its design its that, real smart design and functional, elegant. The camera is amazing and it is super fast to load. I love the fact that 16GB of memory gives you plenty of storage to download all the apps. I recommend it without hesitating."
7314,Great phone like a mini computer for real. Love screen size and clarity. Lots of covers to pick from.  Much better than last Samsung i had for sure. 
7315,As an avid iPhone user I started out with the 4s and loved it. I never had any issues with this phone. The size of this iPhone was perfect for my tiny hands and I could easily use all features. 
7316,I Kirk it but I am ready for a new phone I have had this phone a long time . I'm not a gadget junkie so I don't know what's good and what isn't but it worked for me .
7317,"I had this phone for 3 years and it did so well for me. my only complaint is that I wish I would have gone with more memory. I take a ton of pictures and I really wish that it didn't keep telling me that the storage was almost full. I switched to a android powered phone for a year and hated every second of it. I learned the hard way, I am definitely an ""Apple"" girl. "
7318,"I loved this phone at first, but as it ages the battery gets so bad that you have to charge it multiple times a day. "
7319,Good phone. But the 5 is way better . With the 4 I couldn't message with WiFi or call. But the 5 I could. It is very affordable. I love how the 4 was small. Not the phones a too big . I had my 4 for 3 years and never had a problem. Always room for improvement 
7320,Picking this one because i have AT&T. really liked this phone and did not have many problems at all. Definitely #TEAMiPHONE Can do anything a computer can do in the palm of your hand. and pretty user friendly. The 6S did come with improvements.
7321,"I love anything Apple. Not because I'm an apple nerd. But, because of the easiness of Apple IOS. I work with phones daily, and see every issue imaginable. But the 4s never gave me much trouble with my personal use. Just the battery died sooner than I liked after I had it for a long time. But the phone was phenomenal "
7322,Awesome phone! And super resilient. I'm a super clumsy person and this phone ends up on the floor several times a day and has yet to have gotten a crack. 
7323,It is a good phone don't get me wrong but it was slow even with the upgrade and the camera was iffy. 
7324,"The Apple iPone 4s was an amazing phone when it came out. The introduction of Siri was a game changer for me. Voice to text became 100% easier and Siri makes life easier, from looking up recipes with just a touch of a button to repeatedly asking her what does the fox say. The main drawback was,like all iPhones, the battery life was horrible. All in all, although somewhat obsolete, the iPhone 4s is a good phone. "
7325,I absolutely LOVE this phone. I h as 've had it for a while now and it is just a great phone it is super easy to use. And I love the camara and the speed of the pbone. It is a very reliable phone. I can always count on my phone to work no matter were I am. I wouldn't change anything.
7326,"Me gusta porque tiene muchas funciones, es rapido, la calidad de las fotos es buena y ademas el tamaño ideal"
7327,"Increíble teléfono! Uno de los mejores en el mundo, para mí IPHONE es el mejor, best brand for phones, a little expensive, vale la pena totalmente, es un teléfono hermoso, clásico, y de buena calidad, el software es fácil de usar, apps para lo que quieras, tengo 4 años con el mío. Y aún puede dar más de él. Increíble este teléfono. No cambio Apple por nada en el mundo! "
7328,Can't update high enough. I didn't get to use or even see the skin colored emojis let alone the new foods and etc.
7329,This phone is a decent phone. Only problem I have is the screen seems to be so easily cracked or shattered. Its definitely not for me being a mother of two children that love to play on my phone. 
7330,"No tengo grandes quejas para el Iphone, son totalmente confiables, sus funciones son excelentes, la calidad de imagen es muy buena. El único ""Pero..."" que le pondría al esta marca es que no es practico en cuanto a musica, nos obliga a comprar canciones. "
7331,Antiguo pero eficaz. Llevo aproximadamente 6 años con el y va exactamente como el primer día. Para mi esta marca es la mejor sin duda.
7332,I loved my 4s!! It was a great size phone and I never had issues with anything. 
7333,This iphone is a tresore for me because i have all i need and what i need in it 
7334,"Works well for around 3 years then it is falling apart. I still like how easy Apple phones are to use, but they are definitely a rip off. "
7335,"Great phone!

This one like every apple product it's a great purchase. BUT, My girlfriend have this model and after few years from one day to another the wi-fi antenna and bluetooth stop working without reason"
7336,"My first iPhone I ever had it was good when they first came out but do not get a 16gb apple product unless it's an iPod.. If you get a 16gb apple iPhone you're going to have a bad time.. It will come more than half way filled up already and when you don't have any storage on your phone left it will be virtually useless, always crashing and freezing up. "
7337,Loveeeeeeee this phone! So easy to use! Love the apps and how the camera takes very clear pictures. I like how big the phone is because its not to big to fit in your back pocket and not that small that you cannot enjoy a good video.
7338,"I love my iPhone 4s. I don't have the 16GB, mines around 30GB, this Iphone is amazing (as is every apple product!) I think the only problem with this phone is that since it is getting older things run a little slower and in very short order I will stop getting updates. My suggestion is that if you are going to get an iPhone... Ever if it is more money, get one of the newer ones that make it worth while having and iPhone. "
7339,Love this phone. Realize I'm a little behind S most people have the 5 now. Don't plan on getting a 5 till my 4s stops working. 
7340,"I had my iPhone 4s for over 2 years and I loved it! Started to have problems with it holding a charge and being kinda slow towards the end, but it was normal wear and use type things."
7341,"Overall, I am happy with my phone and it does everything I need too. However, the camera is not as good as I had hoped. I think it could have taken better quality photos. Also I feel that I need more storage on my phone. "
7342,Love it but i don't get the updates the other iphones gets but other thn that it is a good phone
7343,The iPhone is not my cup of tea. I prefer the ability to customize my phone right down to the font. it is a user friendly platform but it simply isn't for me.
7344,"First of all, I was given a free iPhone because my mom was eligible for an upgrade, so I took it. That being said, I do not like iPhones for being glitchy, easy to hack, and just back door-y. I had that phone for a year and the best feature is the phone."
7345,"My mom has this phone and it is decent. It does what is expected, but is very slow compared to the newer versions of the iPhone. "
7346,"I love the 'live' feature on the photos, hands down my favorite new feature that Apple has added to their product arsenal! Otherwise, the phone isn't life-changing, and you still need a great case to protect the super fragile screen. Always fun to have their latest product though."
7347,Apple products are amazing! Worth the money you pay for them. User friendly 100% and easy to use. These phones have so many rescor
7348,"This was my very first Apple product, and it had me hooked from there on out. I refuse to purchase any other product from any other brand. I love the design, layout, camera, functionality, etc with the Iphone."
7349,I have been an I phone user for a long time. This brand has proven to have a good quality and easy to use. 
7350,"I love iphone, It met all my expectations. It has been 3 years after I bought it already. Its working perfectly fine yet. "
7351,I miss this phone!  It was so great and tiny!  When will Apple make smaller phones again?  Hopefully soon because I hate large accessories!
7352,"I have had my iPhone 4s for awhile now (As of April 2016) and refuse to get a new iPhone. Why? Because when an iPhone is jailbroken it becomes way better than any Android on the market, also the battery life is great and its a tough phone overall, not very prone to damage if fallen... Especially if its in an Otterbox."
7353,My cousin had this phone for a long time till she upgraded and she loved it! 
7354,"I had this phone for a while before I passed it along to my daughter.  Now that I have a 6, it looks small!  It worked fine, was easy to use and held lots of music but I did find that the screen cracked easily. I would strongly suggest a good case if you opt to use this phone. "
7355,I own a apple iphone 4s and i love it only down fall is the screwn cracked but it is a glass screen if your careful its a great phone used for a while. i phones are great smart phones for any age price isn't to bad 
7356,Memory fills up too fast. Some apps won't upgrade unless you use Wi-Fi upgrade app. Battery runs down but charges relatively quick. I can't download some apps I want with the 4S but you get used to living w/o. They cost $. And the phone freezes up sometimes! Won't do anything until you power it down. And turns back on?  Hopefully. Time for a new phone!
7357,"I love this phone so much. I haven'y upgraded because of just how reliable and easy to use this phone is! The camera is nice, not extremely high end, but does the job for vacation pictures and that sort of thing. The navigation is super nice, and the size is perfect for me and my tiny hands.  The down side is that I switched from AT&T to Verizon and I'm finding that it's not as good, but it's defiantly not a deal breaker."
7358,"This phone lasted 3 times longer than my crappy Blackberry did, and it sustained more of a beating than my old BB. Doubt I'll ever use anything other than Apple. "
7359,"Love my iphone. I basically have all apple products, they never let me down. Anytime there is a problem, I just go to my local store"
7360,"I've used this phone for the last 3 years. It's a durable little phone. The battery does drain semi quick though - and I did have some issues turning the data plan on and off, but overall I was happy with the phone. "
7361,"I love iPhones! The quality of pictures is amazing. I don't think it's the same quality as Samsung. If you like to take pictures with your phone, this is the way to go. I definitely used it everyday for almost everything. All the apps and updates, it's coming to a point that we need the phone. "
7362,Hate this phone. has become outdated and slow and the charge never lasts. the price is ridiculous. 
7363,Long lasting phone with not all up to date technology but still has all the usable software you would need to do everything social media wise 
7364,I love all apple products most of the time when I buy electronics its going to be an apple product I think they are reliable and have so many features the only thing I don't like it all the damn updates but who am I kidding thats any electronic device  
7365,"Was cute and a good phone until the 6 came! I loved the 4, it was easy to use and a good fit for pockets"
7366,It's a very good product. I love it but can use better screen. I recommend it to everyone  
7367,"I have had this phone since Dec 2011 and it has served me well. Best features are ease of use and compatibility with the many apps and programs. At this point battery is giving up and I haven't upgraded to the latest IOS for fear losing some critical functionality. I would repurchase a newer model and definitely recommend. I also love the fact that I can virtually store and share my data seamlessly with my Ipad which is much newer. At this point I couldn't go back to any another smart phone out there. For instance, a few friends and family have the latest Samsung but I get overwhelmed by how unnecessarily complicated it is to use it.seems to be. "
7368,I love iPhone because it's so easy to use. I was happy that they released a bigger phone so the display was better. It was affordable at Best Buy. I will continue to purchase Apple phones because they are great phones. Samsung is too complicated for me. 
7369,"I love iphones. I especially like the 4s. I prefer the smaller size than the 5 or 6 I can`t wait for the new smaller version. I don`t like that we have to update all the time and it seems to take so long. I also wish they were slightly more affordable.
"
7370,Love this iphone because is small and you can ut it in your jean pocket or feels in any purse and you can fine anying you. Need 
7371,Although I upgraded to a 6Plus the Apple 4S was a good phone. It was easy to operate and took great photos also. Enjoyed using this phone.
7372,I've had this phone for almost a year now and it glitches a lot. It's very easy to use and I've always had iPhones. A complaint I have is that you need a lot of storage to have everything you want. I am always having a storage problem. I think there's definitely adjustments that could be made. 
7373,"This phone its ok, is a good phone  but its not my favorite, the cam is most better in other phones, the price is good. "
7374,"To me iphone 4s  is the best iphone.It's really fast and really easy to use.I just love the camera,it's amazing.Photos look like they were taken with really expensive camera.
This device is not slow at all,it's really great."
7375,"Good cellphone. Can get a little glitchy, especially the older it gets. I've definitely gotten good use out of it! Love the camera and the sleek black color."
7376,"📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱📱 
I had this phone for a while.....this basically the same as the 5 or and 6. Note this phone is small!!!! "
7377,"Very slow system, and when there is an update the phone gets worse because it's so outdated. Not worth the money!"
7378,Apple Computers Apple iPhone 4S 16GB Smartphone (White) (Unlocked) is bad compared to android! Apple fanboys come at me bro!
7379,I had this phone for 4 years and it was really nice. Now a days of course it's little and a lot of the time the apps crash or I can't update it but it was a great product.
7380,Great phone just severely outdated by this point. I used it for years before switching to Android. While I am more of an Android person than Apple I did enjoy my experience with this phone. Its just so old that you don't want to buy it now. Get a newer model. 
7381,This iPhone not only allows you to keep in touch with friends and family but capture moments of every day .
7382,Great little phone my favorite iPhone. Never had any problem with mine still works now had it the day it came out.. I gave a iPhone 6plus but still love the 4
7383,I love my iPhone it is the only type of phone I have ever used although I would like to upgrade to a 5 my iPhone 4 is definitely my bestfriend 
7384,"Very slow, camera quality isn't the greatest, it met my expectations for a phone, storage isn't the greatest, it's a bit small and pricey for a phone, it overall works good, great apps, not much to do on the 4, i would definitely recommend their other phones! "
7385,I used to have one before its it was good I liked the camera but it was just to small
7386,"I like this phone and it is my first adventure into smart phones. I have been reluctant to get them b/c I do not see the need for all of the added features but I desperatly needed an upgrade. This phone is nice and meets my expectations in many ways but in others it does not. My biggest issue with this phone is that I can not access the internet unless I connect to a wifi signal so if I'm in my car or outside my house I""m out of luck which is really annoying. "
7387,Great product. Used it for 4 years before it gave out. Upgraded to the iPhone 6s. Loved the camera and battery life. 
7388,"In my opinion, this was the most user friendly iPhone. everything could truly be done in one hand because the screen wasn't too big. The one downfall was the weight and the screens easily cracking. "
7389,"I used this phone for 3 years straight. I covered it with an otter box phone case and never put a scratch on it. Surprisingly, it was very easy for me to adjust from an old flip phone to the 4s. Every feature was an upgrade in my case. One complaint I have is that I should have bought one with more gigs. I filled the 16gb in about 2 years and had to put 100s of pictures on my computer"
7390,"I really like my phone, me encanta los productos de apple son los mejores por la seguridad que me dan "
7391,It was great I recently updated to the six but I kind of wish I still had the four it's somewhat affordable and it works well it's very reliable and great for just about anything my favorite feature is siri it's so helpful the only improvement is it doesn't have the touch home button to unlock feature but I would definitely recommend
7392,I really like my iPhone 4s. It is so convenient and I use it for everything. It seems to be reliable which is why I haven't upgraded because of the flaws in the newer models. The 4s is very affordable and I would suggest the older models like this on rather than the newer ones.
7393,"Excellent phone, a great product , very easy to understand and use.  Met my expectations to have a 4s i Phone.  Wish these phone were around 10 years ago."
7394,"Amazing phone! Isn't slow and has a durable body.. My iPhone 4s has lasted me years its personally the best out of some of the models of the iPhone's since this one is more ""blocky"" than most of the iPhones now it is defiantly more durable and more likely to survive a fall! "
7395,"I got this phone just under 3 weeks ago and its brilliant so far. The camera is amazing and it is super fast to load and take pictures, compared to how long the camera on my Sony Xperia Miro took to load and the actual megapixels. I find that I have to charge it almost every day but it doesn't really bother me that much. I haven't had any problems with ios 7.1.1 unlike some owners of iPhone 4s's. I got mine from eBay for $200- 32gb with a lot of scratches only seen in light and a crack and the colour being white."
7396,"I liked my iphone and had it for a long time before the screen shattered beyond belief. I replaced the screen myself but a few months later it again broke so I gave in and decided it was time to just get the next phone up, otherwise this was a great phone with a better battery life than the 5s and it did well. "
7397,"I am ready to get rid of this product just because of all the new phones out. It will frequently ask you to upgrade because it needs to be caught up to other phones. This phone is affordable because it is an older version. I would recommend apple products, but not the 4. "
7398,"I had high hopes as it was my first iPhone, I did not see what made it so different I have had other phones that I liked better, got it for a fair price at argos second hand. It sometimes freezes."
7399,I love this phone. It has all the functionality I needed at the time. Best feature of course is the speakers. Great for music. Small and compact. 
7400,I've had this smartphone since 2012 and it still work perfectly. Although because in the past it has suffer several falls the camara doesn't work the same way as before. 
7401,This was my first iPhone and i loved it! It meet almost all my expectations. It was small and it worked to do what I needed. It was easy to use not confusing for me at all. It might have just been a bit to fragil but then again I am clumsy and there's always room for improvement that why I upgraded to the iPhone 6
7402,"I miss this phone! It lasted me six years before it went black-screen. The height of this phone was the best for keeping it in your pocket, which I appreciated. Service was good for the most part and it was very easy to navigate straight from the box."
7403,"Great phone overall. However, the home button is loose and turns around but never falls off. The lock button is stuck in and is not functional anymore. "
7404,"I absolutely love my iPhone, the camera is so amazing, sometimes too amazing, its lightweight and the best feature i have to say would be live videos, it would be great if it was avail;le to all iPhones but even just for myself these are great features"
7405,I love my Apple iPhone I think it's very useful and it helps me with every day tasks
7406,"IPhone 4s is the slowest iPhone I ever had. But it still works fine, has everything any other iPhone has. "
7407,I love apple. apple is absolutely my favorite phone brand. its definitely better than Samsung or any other phone brand. the quality sound is good and the touch screen quality is really good to. I really recommend the apple brand its a awesome brand.  
7408,"This is an okay phone, though I miss my android. Calls are more clear with this phone, and the apps I'm able to get now are great. My music is smoothr, and it's great to be able to FaceTime my friends who also have an iPhone. I'm so glad I made the switch!"
7409,"The battery on this phone is not the best, and the phone constantly dies. It is also difficult to trouble shoot. "
7410,"I have no complains regarding this product. This was my first iPhone and I have to say, it was a great purchase. I have it for two years now, and is still working just as well. I was tired of the other cheaper options, that stopped working after 8-12 months. If you want something to last long, go for iPhones. "
7411,Bashful did did did dude did d dyed end udmd do. Didn't jsns cud did find jdjdnsjd . Jsns didn't did shades susnz susnz did d dudb.
7412,I like the 4s iPhone because the updates are the same as the newer iPhones and I never had any problem with my Apple device but I upgraded to a different brand. But I'm keeping my iPhone just invade I may need a back up in the future LOL 
7413,Terrible battery life and camera. Use my phone as my camera but this was the reason I switched. Battery was dying every couple of hours 
7414,Better than other smartphones I've had but won't let me update to OS8 so I can't downloads lot of apps
7415,This was the first iphone I have ever bought ! I was so amazed by both it's image and sound quality .. it is a very good device that have survived many accidents haha and guess what ! I STILL HAVE IT AND IT WORKS PERFECTLY AS IF IT WAS NEW
7416,I used to love apple but ever since Steve jobs died it has gone down the toilet. Any update they try to do on your phone will seriously screw it up! If you can't afford to upgrade your phone to the newest one every time it comes out then I would not go with Apple. Once my contract is up with sprint I will be getting a different phone and it will NOT be Apple ever again! Seriously hate them now. Do NOT ever update your phone unless you want it to crash all. The. Time. 
7417,"I loved everything about this phone. But like with any technology there is always a new model coming out, making this outdated very soon. I love how user friendly the phone is. I wish they would offer a little better pricing"
7418,"I Loved my iPhone for the easy to use features, great clear camera with really great storage. It's easy to use and I like that you can choose the color and It wasn't out of range for price range with comparable features. It's very slim and stylist looking :)"
7419,I have had this phone for a year and its awesome. every one else has iphone 6 and i have a iphone 4s it works awesome it was affordable. since it was a phone. it met my expectations and i just needed it to call and text. yes i would recommend this to others .
7420,"Enjoyed having my 4s very much. This was a great phone for many years. I liked the size and shape of the 4 s. The phone and apps worked great , never had any problems, it was time to upgrade this month when new apps wouldn't work on the old technology of the phone. "
7421,I love my phone. Sometimes it is slow. Sad that I can't get a higher version but it works.
7422,"I have always (since they came out) and will always love Apple products. I love my iPhone (currently have the new iPhone SE). I love the camera, how easy it is to use, and the fact that if something goes wrong it's usually an easy fix (and generally, things don't go wrong). Big fan :)"
7423,"I would have to say I'm a total apple freak. All my electronics are apple 
From my desktop iPad iPhone I have it all 
I would recommend these products to anyone 
The price is definitely not cheap and the constant new electronics that come out can be aggravating but I can't seem to get away "
7424,This is my first apple product. It is actually a 5. The size is perfect but I would love the newer and bigger 6. The only thing I don't like is if I am away from wifi and no data turned on I can't receive texts from people sending me an iMessage. So it could be hours before I get their text. 
7425,"I love it , easy to use, handle my kids harsh using. I will definitely get another I phone when i want to upgrade."
7426,"I started using the iPhone's at the 3 and now at the 5s.... I have loved them ALL!!

The only downside is I should've bought the bigger GBs storage. I finally wised up and got the 32 this time. 

Now I'm wishing I got the 64. Lol. "
7427,"This is the best phone I had ever had and I will now always buy iPhones. I had it for like 5 years and it still worked perfectly. So easy to use. Durable. I dropped it about 1,000 times a day and it was always perfectly fine. started running out of memory eventually but that's to be expected because I never deleted texts or pictures. "
7428,"This was a handmedown from my mom when she upgraded her phone to the 6s. I had a lot of complaints for the iPhone and Apple phones in general. The best feature was the phone feature, really, but it started clutching out and would hang up the call regardless of my service. I have another iPhone, but for necessity."
7429,"I still have this phone as a backup and it's going strong.  Yes it's a tad slow now, but even with no case, it's been heavy duty with no scratches and is better then the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 that I use today.  "
7430,Love this phone so much I even dropped it a million times before it finally shattered so I upgraded to the 5s
7431,I had mine for 3 years and it worked perfectly for about 2 but it just started crashing and stuff
7432,"I hade the iPhone 4 for around 3 years and it was Satisfactory, it was good until better phones came out and Totally down graded this one. After about a year it wasn't working to its standards. The camera Quality was the worst "
7433,Easy to use probably need to get the updated version however but I do love all my apple products! 
7434,Was good.  Liked all the different options available. Nice size. Style was  good.  The price was okay for this product. It did meet my expectations and did what it was supposed to 
7435,"I loved it! worked awesome for me, and used it for awhile. it was affordable and fit my budget perfectly. i loved how simple it was to use and easy to access everything. it was everything i expected! I wish the lock buttons and home button lasted longer though. "
7436,"I've had this phone for almost 4 years before I finally upgraded! This phone has lasted a long time & was in good condition. I have dropped it many times ( in a case) & it still worked. However, overtime the battery died faster, I constantly needed to upgrade the software & it became annoying. This was my first iPhone & I still have it. "
7437,"I currently have an iphone 4s and I personally feel there's always a problem with it. It's very easy to use and understand though. It's a little pricey for the amount of problems it tend to have. It did not meet my expectations, there's always a series of bad events occurring with this phone. Some examples include it losing battery power VERY rapidly, to the point where I have to charge it more than 4 times a day. It randomly shuts off even though it's at a good battery percentage. Currently, my screen is black but the battery is fine, and I can hear my notifications and sounds but it's just a black screen which is EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING. I f you want an iphone, i would recommend purchasing a newer version because you'll screw yourself over with this one :)"
7438,"I have to say, I go through phones like nobody's business...but it seems that whenever I have an iPhone- I have it the longest. I've had this phone for over a year and it's never frozen up like others have in the past. The only thing is, with 16 gb for me- I feel that it isn't enough! I find myself deleting pictures and apps a lot...if you're not one for using a lot of apps or downloading music, I recommend this 16 gb, but If you're like me, id go with at least the 32!"
7439,Its old but its good! had mine for three years dropped it in a moving truck and it finally broke the new phones are probably better so id give apple a try!
7440,I like it so far but would like to see some  emoji's  In the key bored setting for texting.
7441,It runs slow but has nice camera quality it's just a little downgrade but it's usable in a way
7442,At the time the phone was great.  Now that there are better phones the 4s doesn't do the job. The screen broke 4 times since I got it making it very expensive to fix. My favorite features are the imessaging and easy usability. I also like how compatible it was with my other apple products. 
7443,"
MY FAVORITE .
It is an excellent tool, in my case my life , my office , my all this inside my cell . I think I could not live without . I would love to have a new one but still I have not been able to buy more but if there is a cell phone to recommend to all we like the quality, speed and excellence in iphone"
7444,I love this iPhone but sprint wasn't a good service provider... The phone cracked in the back after a few months when it dropped...
7445,"Good phone!! 

Iv had this phone for a while now I got a iPhone 5 and they messed up so had to send it back and I went back to my 4s!! And have been hawing this for a while now it's a good phone never had no problems with it. "
7446,My first iPhone...it lasted for around two years and I loved how the pictures first turned out. I love apple!
7447,"I like this phone because I feel it is the perfect size, and I've never had problems with it"
7448,My husband and I have been using iPhones since 2012 and we will never go back to any other phone. iPhones are super user friendly and easy to use. I can even print from my iPhone.
7449,"Highly recommended this phone for every day of every citizen , with a great use in tasks , learning, and everything else , any use large memory capacity for reminders"
7450,"This is the fourth iphone I have purchased for a member of my family. It is easy to use, and is pretty quick when it comes to processing applications. However, wih 3 young boys all of cell phone age, I sure would like to see one of these phones be slightly more difficult to damage. The screens are always breaking, which baffles me for the price point. We can put  people in apartments we've built in space, but my iphone cant fall 3 feet to the floor without breaking."
7451,They are not durable for teenagers. Since the product is all the rave they all had to have them of course. But even with a otter box case the backs cracked easily
7452,"I had this phone for a while, now I have a 6. But all Apple phones I've used have been amazing. "
7453,I love this product a lot. It really works well and is really quick and effective for me to get me through my busy life!
7454,I loved my 4s apple iphone I had it for 5 yrs. loved the size of the phone the most. I also own apple macbook air which is the best for watching movies and youtube.
7455,I have one n I did love it tell the up greaded to a 6 n now there apps I can not download because my phone doseint go up to ios8 smh
7456,Este fue mi primer IPhone y puedo decir que a partir de ese momento no quiero utilizar otra marca. Es la mejor en lo que a teléfonos móviles se trata. Cada día mejorando en todos los aspectos. No lo cambiaría por ningún otro. Actualmente sigo renovando mis equipos todos los años siendo fiel a la marca Apple 
7457,I actually own an iphone 4 and its black it works great i haven't gotten the iphone 5 because tgis one gets the job done.
7458,Love Apple and all of the products they provide but this phone has been the worst I have ever received. it is very slow and does not update very well
7459,This product is ok. Hard to judge it when I now own a 6s which is a great phone!
7460,Love my iPhone. Always get's the job done and everything is on the same device and it's awesome!
7461,This is a great product and i miss having it. Wish I. Ever broke it. I recommend this to anyone! Love it! And so will you! 
7462,Great phone. Everyone loves Apple. Only upgraded from this one to a 5S because I take a lot of photos so wanted higher image quality. 
7463,I love this phone. Its small and it takes pretty pictures. I haven't had a phone this good luke this one
7464,"It's a decent phone, compared to the more advanced ones currently in 2016. iPhones in general are very easy to navigate with and are user friendly. Downsides, I feel that the battery drains quickly if I use it too much, and the camera quality isn't that good but only compared to the newer phones."
7465,"I would recommend this over and over again! Awesome, sleek, and smooth, and all around awesome!!! "
7466,"I enjoy this phone. I recommend it to parents who may be seeking to get their gradeschooler their first phone or anyone doing business that may need a second line. It updates with all the other apple products, charges fast, and the camera quality is fairly good especially in the right lighting. It has majority of the other basic functions of iPhone, the only issue I have is that the screen is a bit small for my liking."
7467,We bought this used for my twelve year old son. He really likes it. The only thing I have noticed is the battery goes dead quickly. The other thing is that it freezes up  fairly often.
7468,"I still have this phone and I can't really complain about it. I love it, it's literally my baby"
7469,Had this phone for maybe two years and it never gave me problems. iPhones are so main stream because they get the job done. Can't deny that.
7470,Great phone. Lasted me the 2 years that I had to wait for an upgrade. Apple always makes a good product 
7471,Love this phone.  Extremely user friendly. Never gets infected with viruses. It works exactly the way I'm thinking 
7472,"This phone is so amazing to have, even if it's the old version! My friends still have their iPhone lasting a lot!"
7473,I have always had an ipone. I think I just stay with apple products because hat is what I am comfortable with.
7474,I will never use any other smart phone other than Apple. So reliable and amazing technology!!
7475,Love love this phone so much love love would not trade it for another phone never never team apple alll the way 
7476,"I will use this 4s until it dies, Iphones have so much more space than I was getting on any android device. I'm so glad I made the switch. "
7477,Love this phone! no problems at all! great purchase! never freezes and quick to respond. 
7478,"This product is great. The camera features are the best! It also has great, pretty effects. "
7479,Overall great phone I love the color and display it displays colors very nicely and it is very easy to use
7480,"Too old phone, I can not wait to get my new one. The iPhone 4G has been too slow and it has annoyed me."
7481,"I had one and loved! lasting battery, sturdy note 10 performance at the time. great design, really nice"
7482,LOVE IT GREATEST PHONE EVER SO SLEEK AND SHINY AND HOLDS ALL  MY MUSIC AND PHOYOS WITOUT
7483,"Tuve este celular por aproximadamente 2 años y la verdad es que no tengo queja de él. Es un buen producto, resistente, buen audio, cámara frontal y trasera bastante buenas. Sin dudas es una buena opción"
7484,This phone worked great for a while but began to really slow down with the new updates. I now use it solely to just play music and it works great as an mp3 player. 
7485,This was one of the very first apple products I have ever purchased. It was such a great phone that I just recently upgraded.
7486,"I now have the iPhone 6, however i used to have the iPhone 4S a few years back. i love all of the iPhones, and feel that every time the come out with a new one it is always better than the one before. the iPhone is always up with the newest forms of technology and are very user friendly. they are my favorite phone of all time!"
7487,"My friends and family converted me from being an android user to an apple user so I bought the iphone 4 just to get used to using apple. I'm completely hooked and the iphone 4 is just a good starter phone. No complaints. The phone is so user friendly, everything just runs well and is so easy. "
7488,"A little too big for my hand, even in the smaller size-- but I love the interface and would never stray from Apple because the UX is so good. Also love the dark grey/silver colorway!"
7489,"I'd never by anything but an iPhone.  I just wish I purchased the extra storage!  The screen is great though, I can't count the amount of times my son has dropped my phone, and it never breaks!  Apple is stepping up their damage control game!"
7490,"There are many great things to say about the Apple iPhone 4S, but the absence of 4G access is perplexing. There's no denying that the phone's data transfer speed is better than most devices under most circumstances, but it's not all that it could be if it had access to the Verizon Wireless and AT&T 4G LTE networks or Sprint's WiMax network.

One of our favorite relatively new features available on many smartphones is the ability to make video calls, and in this arena, Apple's FaceTime is as good as it gets. It's simple to use and works flawlessly on the iPhone 4S. Even though the front-facing camera offers only VGA resolution, it's perfectly adequate for this task.

Regardless of the wireless carrier you choose, the iPhone 4S is a world phone. That's always the case with AT&T phones because they operate on the world-standard GSM system. Verizon Wireless and Sprint use the CDMA cellular system in the U.S. and Canada, but it's rare and unusable in most places outside of North America. To remedy that with these carriers, the iPhone 4S can automatically switch to GSM when overseas. It will not operate on GSM with them in the U.S. and Canada, however."
7491,I got this phone right when the 5s was coming out so the phone was very old. It worked well it was just really slow. 
7492,I love the apples 4 personaly it feels so compact in my hand  fits well. and easy to use . the only down fall is that having tried the samsungs and downgrading again to apple iphone 4 since it broke. the keyboard is quite small.and not a lot of variety in the way of  making notes. or getting apps since apple tries to consistently add new tech. for newer apple phones and slightly degrade other phone tech in terms of update and apps. compared to a samsung they leave it open for all generations.
7493,"This product is amazing. My mom and I use this product as an alarm clock, because we don't have a real alarm clock, and the alarms on our Samsung phones don't wake us up. Great product!"
7494,If you're looking for a really good and sturdy phone that's inexpensive than this is for you.
7495,Anything Apple you can't go wrong with! They also have amazing customer service! Every time I have had to call my problem was solved quickly!
7496,"Perfect ""starter smartphone"" for a young child or less than tech-savvy adult. Beware, due to it's speed, size, and inability to (soon) receive firmware updates, it'll likely be out of date in very short order. Still, it's a nice phone that likely won't cost too much."
7497,"I have had this phone for at least 1 year now and it was the worst phone i have ever had! It goes really slow, takes bad pictures and you have to wait 10 minutes to download i thing.... :/ "
7498,This was my first Apple product. At first I had to get use to the smart phone. But within a few weeks I had it down packed. I love my iPhone and reminds me so much of a miniature computer
7499,Love this except the camera is a bit fuzzy. I really enjoy using the phone and all of its applications.
7500,"AMAZING, I had my for years! It is crazy how long they will last if you actually take care of them!"
7501,Battery life on this phone is great! A very reliable phone. Apple makes quality phones so even though this phone is a few generations older I still think it can hold it's own in the smartphone world. 
7502,"Lasted a really long time. Probably longer than intended by company. Space was not awesome, I needed more. "
7503,"I love it!!! it has a nice sise and its really beautiful , its my first iphone and i love it"
7504,"This was my first iPhone and I loved it! This phone never failed me, never crashed, broke or cracked! the durable of the iPhones I've had! The only thing that made me switch was the sized was a bit small comparatively to the newer models. "
7505,"I recently upgraded to the 6s, but I do miss this phone. It was so nice and fitting to my hand. It never gave me problems or any software or hardware issues!"
7506,"Hello, of course anything Apple is top notch . Very superior and what other smart electionics are tying to be ."
7507,"Good phone overall. If you're trying to save money just get a different kind of phone, besides apple. If you don't have the budget to buy a 5 or higher just get a different kind of phone. It's not worth it."
7508,Had this phone since forever I know I need an upstate but it works so great I'm in no rush 
7509,This phone has lasted a lifetime!!! I got it when if first came out and last year I gave it to my mom and she still has it
7510,Functional and Good for what I use it for It's a personal phone but the buttons ALWAYS break. I have had 4-5 iphone 4s in th past 2 years and they always break one me. Spend the extra hunder or so dollars and buy an updated version. 
7511,"I miss my Samsung. Operating is confusing on the iPhone. I never had any storage problems with my Samsung, after 3 months on my iPhone I was having to delete pics and apps. "
7512,I love apple products definitely recommend this company. It's more on the expensive side but it's worth it 
7513,"After awhile this phone starts running slow because of all the latest Apple devices that came out. The Camera quality isn't the best, but if you need a phone and don't mind the bad camera and how slow it can work at times, this would be fine "
7514,"It's okay. All in all, I would prefer an Android. There is so little memory on the 16 gig that I can't put pictures or music on it, and even with a minimal amount of apps it constantly runs out of memory. I just think are more user-friendly. Apple is a status symbol"
7515,"I had this phone up until September of last year and it was a trusty phone.

It might have had a bad camera compared to my new phone (the 6s 64 gig) but it did the job.

I had it for a good 4 years and it only cracked within the last 6 months. But I had went through 2 speck candyshell cases and 2 otter box defender cases in the duration of having this phone.

The newer software makes the phone run a bit slower.

Also do not get this size phone if you are planning not to delete all your photos after uploading them onto a computer or a hard drive. The space runs out quick.

Overall it was a great phone at its height but now it just lacks in comparison to the newer ones. 

My recommendation: Do not get this phone now but opt for the 5s or the 6"
7516,Best phone ever who doesn't like iphones.they are life very easy to work with but hard to put music only has a very beautiful camera.
7517,I love this iPhone. I miss the iPhone four. It's easy to use. Safari and the iCloud are great features of the phone. It's easy to download apps. The size of the phone is perfect! My very first iPhone and I really do miss it. Speed is good with the phone. Only thing I do not like is that the front is all glass. So be careful and make sure to get a really good case. Other than that phone was perfect 
7518,"I love my iPhone, but there is some things that I think should be changed, I don't like how we can't update our phones anymore to get some apps that I love"
7519,"Para mi es uno de los teléfonos celulares que mas me han gustado ya que el tamaño para mi es perfecto, no esta ni estorboso pero tampoco esta demasiado pequeño, hablando de aplicaciones no varían mucho con el paso de los años pero es muy bueno ya que el procesador es muy rápido "
7520,"I use an iPhone 4s on a daily basis.  I love the quality, but I would love to upgrade to an iPhone 6."
7521,Its okay I hate that the screen is so tiny and it runs very slow at times. Other then that it has good quality pictures and that apps work good.
7522,This is my 10 year olds phone and it is just fine for her she loves it and it is perfect first time phone 
7523,"I loved it, i had it for 2 years, and as an apple phone, works soo good, and its an awesome phone as always"
7524,I've been very happy with my iphone.  I do think that this model is starting to lose it's ability to process more complex requests.  It has slowed considerably in the last month or so.
7525,"This is the phone i have right now and i really regret it, it doesn't take good pictures, the only thing i like about this phone is that it doesn't break easily"
7526,"I've had 3 of this exact phone and each one lasts no longer than a year. My first would go to 27% when I unplugged it, the second one, the bottom volume button and lockscreen button stopped being able to be pushed in, and the screen entirely stopped working on my third. Switched to Samsung!"
7527,Loved it. Keep getting every new iPhone that comes up its addicting Apple iPhone are the best
7528,I've had this phone for 3yrs now and I absolutely love it! It works great has amazing storage space and is so easy to use! Everyone around me has brand new smart phones but I'm totally satisfied with this one! 
7529,I have always owned an apple smartphones. They are user friendly. So many apps that are available. 
7530,"This was my old phone before my iPhone 6 and it's a good phone. I find it unbearably small now, but I didn't feel that way when I had first bought it because most phone weren't as big as they are now. The phone is fast, easy and well made. "
7531,Definitely not my favorite apple product but it was good when it first came out. The newer stuff is much better
7532,Apple Computers Apple - iPhone 4S with 16GB Memory Mobile Phone - White (Sprint)is great but screen cracks too easy.
7533,"Apple makes awesome products everyone knows , that but I think my very favorite thing about these phones is the camera quality , we love taking pictures."
7534,I have an apple I phone it works great I haven't had any trouble with it its very light weight and compact picture quality is amazing 
7535,I am obsessed with my IPhone 4! I've tried the 5 and 6 and went back to the 4 because its just THAT amazing! 
7536,"It's okay. I mean, my phone has been very glitchy. Maybe it's because it's an older model?  I don't know. I really need another phone so....."
7537,I phone works great and they just get better as they contuine to make new ones. i love it.
7538,The speaker of my phone is messing up lately and it's not only because it is an older model but I've noticed with iPhone 5c. that's the only complain I have. and also there's too many app that I don't use that are taking memory space 
7539,So far so good! Great Camera and Great coverage with Cricket. No complaints so far. I love the size. Fits in all my evening clutches. Not giant and clunky.
7540,Love my iPhone just wish it was bigger and not so delicate. I used this phone for 3 years.  Can't go wrong with Apple
7541,For its time it was awesome! My wife had hers till a couple months ago and loved it. She recently upgraded to the 6 gold 64g and could not be happier! Out coverage is t-Mobil and we are definitely in love Ruth truly unlimited data!! 
7542,Head over heels in love and i don't even want to trade up for a 5 or  6 damn no problems what soo ever 
7543,Great phone easy to use very veritable and long lasting screen is a bit small 
7544,I loved this phone! I loved how small this phone was! I wish I still had it 
7545,"Love the fingerprint lock option, helps keep kids off my phone. Way better than the iPhone 4!"
7546,It's the best but it gets the job done what  the most is u can't get the snap chat updates
7547,Love apple product I've have this phone a few years ago and worked perfect! 
7548,This phone is not that bad. It's pretty fast actually. I used to have this phone and it's not that bad. 
7549,Hardiest phone I've ever had. Had it for three years.. Fell down concrete stairs and didn't shatter!! Finally decided to upgrade though.. Will keep as a spare! 
7550,"The 4s is a good phone, but unfortunately was set up to fail from the start. With many known manufactured problems, such as lock button breaking, to the sound failing. All of these were designed to happen after a certain amount of time, to encourage the customer to upgrade to the 5. In my case, and many of my family members, it worked out that way. I enjoy the ios system, however I can't stand how iPhones do not have expandable memory. Also the continuous notifications of ""Storage is almost full"" becomes very irritating. Overall, iPhones are a good product, with room for much improvement. The 4s however, stay away from, unless you have absolutely no other choice. "
7551,"Oh Apple! This phone, while older, still works great. The bulkier phone allows for you to hold on to it easier, some of these uber thin phones just skip out of your hand! I highly recommend getting a case, these things break and debt so easy! Who thought glass on a phone was a great idea? "
7552,"At first switching from an android to an apple phone was a little different, but I love my iPhone 4. The best quality I can say out of any other phones I've ever had!"
7553,Really enjoyed this phone when I had it before I switched to another phone company. Only complaint I have with the apple phones is the music transferring from your phone (app other than itunes) to the computer back onto your phone. Long process.
7554,In my opinion honestly I think that if you drop it it starts to glitch but if you turn it of it will be alright its a good phone📱
7555,Love iPhones! will never switch to another brand again! have had no problems 
7556,I wish I bought an iPhone with more memory and a bigger screen. Good camera. Not much storage. 
7557,"I really love my apple iphone, I tried to go with a android phone and it was the last time I have ever thought of having that kind of phone. My apple device was so much better. "
7558,"Just another phone replaces, but you always know it will work right with apple, no bugs and no problems, much better signal and speeds"
7559,This phone is a good phone but it is definitely dated technology. Runs slowly and doesn't seem to work with 4g. It does have iMessage and Facetime which were the 2 things I was looking for so it serves its purpose for me.
7560,"Not a bad phone, a little on the small side for this day and time, all in all it's not to bad. Siri is a great feature and it met the needs I had at the time "
7561,"I actually got this for Christmas, but I am excited to finally have an iPhone. Most of the time it's slow and/or freezes. If you are looking for an iPhone get a iPhone 5."
7562,"I've never had a problem with Apple products, and this iPhone is no different.  Reliable, durable and fast processing."
7563,"Love my apples, had this phone nothing wrong with it  but just wanted a updated one and a bigger one."
7564,"When the Apple iPhone 4s came out, it was the best smart phone on the market. The consumer user-face is the most straightforward and easy-to-use than any other smart phone on the market. Apple makes all their products to be the best that people need. You will not be dissatisfied with the Apple iPhone. "
7565,"Loved this phone for many years.  Wish it had most Gigs - I finally ran out of space and had to upgrade to a 6, but I still have it and use it as an iPod for games and music."
7566,"I bought this smartphone because I was a newbie to these phones.  I found it user friendly; everything on one screen, easy updates; camera is great and I would recommend this product."
7567,"IPhone 4 is the perfect phone! It's the perfect size it fits in your hand so nicely, I love the shape. This phone is just amazing as also the other iPhones also but this one I like the size then any others"
7568,"I had this phone for quite some time. It was slow, the buttons were constantly breaking, and the battery would die very quickly. It broke on me in the end after about a year or so. "
7569,"This iphone is not one I would recommend. I have had it for only 1 year and it is very old and slow. If you need a simple smart phone for email, text, safari, and other simple procedures than it might be god for you. However, if you like using a lot of apps, the running time and working of the phone is very slow and untrustworthy. Hoping to upgrade to 6s soon."
7570,Love this phone it is small  but does everything a bigger phone does. It has an easy to use screen and you can put stuff in folders where you can find it easy
7571,If your looking for a sterdy phone than this is for you. I dropped this phone plenty of times and it never cracked. The camera is okay but it could be better.
7572,I still have the old phone and j think is amazing well any product from Apple is amazing I can't wait to upgrade!
7573,This is a nice phone that has a lot of nice features. I like that it isn't too big like the newest versions and can easily fit into my pocket. 
7574,This is one of my favorite phone! super easy to use and so cute. the only problem is that both of mine broke within 4 months. 
7575,I love this phone a great upgrade. The perfect amount of storage for my needs.  I was really excited about the camera and beautiful pictures! 
7576,Good if you don't let it update automatically... It is better to wait for other people to say the update is stable before installing it. You could be without some apps for a while. 
7577,"It works okay but would def recommend getting the 5 or 6 instead, this one can be slow sometimes and not as many upgrades or apps."
7578,What can i say that wasn't said already it's a great phone if you don't have what the hell are you waiting for go get one 
7579,"It just didn't compare to my Samsung Galaxy, I think iPhone needs better features and apps"
7580,"No tengo uno, pero mis amigos sí! Y es lo mejor, las fotos son espectaculares y es super rápido su procesador"
7581,I had this phone before. It's very fast and has lots of space. I recommend this for younger kids. 
7582,I love this phone I have it now and can not be away from it. I have no idea what I would do without it.
7583,"Love the iPhone 

I love iPhone more then any other phone out there. So easy to use. So much better than android phones. "
7584,IPhone has great battery life. But not as many apps r easily available as compared to Android platform.
7585,Even though I lost this phone and was broken I really liked it BC it might not be the latest phone but it sure works really good 
7586,This phone hAs everything you need at a great price absolutely love it .it has space for apps .the phone is cute has many features its great for a first phone i would highly recommend. 
7587,This was the first apple product I had purchased and it gote hooked on Apple products. The look is sleek and modern. Easy to use and has a variety of functions that helps improve daily life. Picture quality is wonderful. Stands up to my busy life and my toddler!
7588,I've had this phone for 3 years and it still works as fast as the first time I got it. Works with the newest ios update which is nice. 
7589,I have always love the apple systems. To me it seems so much better than android and with it have the icloud I can't does anything that is important to me.
7590,I LOVE APPLE!!! They are user friendly and great quality. The  one thing I would change if I could is the price. The only issue I had with this specific phone (mine was not unlocked though; it was AT&T) would be that my WiFi broke and would not work. 
7591,My favorite by far. Easy to use and access. Easy to find accesseries for it. Easy to fit in pocket purse 
7592,This was my first ever iphone. I have been hooked ever since and would not switch to another brand. I actually have a samsung galazy s5 for work and it is just awful. I hate it! Do the right thing and switch to Apple now!!
7593,I love the features iPhone offers.  It is user friendly and a very good product.  Never had any problems with this phone.  
7594,Big fan of apple products. Everyone in my home is an apple user... Highly recommend 
7595,It's a great little phone but it is a little small for my liking. It can take a beating though.
7596,I love my iPhone 4s. It is the best phone I have ever had. It is like having a little computer always handy. 
7597,"As for the Apple phone brand has always been my favorite, they are fast, have good camera and work very well. Updates are getting better with every new phone that comes on the market increases tecnoligía doing a better phone. The camera will always be great."
7598,Great phone just wish they were more durable. I dropped it once maybe a foot off the ground and the screen shattered.
7599,"Working still to this day,  got it 2 years ago and I even dropped it in water and it still surviving "
7600,"Terrible phone. It freezes a lot, very slow. I use this phone with Straight Talk. When you use apps like Snapchat, you don't get to use the cool filters like everyone has even though you have the software up to date. I will never get an Iphone again."
7601,My first smart phone and man is it smart. Do have to get my daughter to help me with certain tasks on it but once you figure it out you're good to go.
7602,"I bought this as a gift for a family member, and they love how well it fits into their hand 😊"
7603,I loved my iPhone but I hated how you. Couldn't get he newest up date for Apple with  this version of te iphone
7604,I am in love with my iPhone best phone I have ever bought.. Works anazing and definitely worth the money.. I have an iPhone 4 and my son has an iPhone 6
7605,"I love apple products.  This phone is easy to use, however due to the glass on both sides of the phone it is easy to break.  The battery life of the phone is also not that great. "
7606,I love my iPhone. I was thinking about upgrading but my phone is still awesome. It's fast and has awesome apps.
7607,Que no puedo decir de mi teléfono si es el que estoy usando estoy más que contenta con esta herramienta de trabajo más que eso puedo estar en contacto con mi familia en México vídeo llamadas sin cobro alguno con mis chulas seguidoras de mi canal de YouTube la cámara está increíble vídeos todo más que un celular forma parte de mi vida diaria y no puedo salir sin micelular es más ni al baño puedo dejar de ir sin mi cel en verdad es más que una marca muchísimos dicen hay eres fresa traes un Apple no claro que no es por comodidad si una puede darse el gusto pues no lo damos y ya 
7608,"This has been a super reliable and user-friendly phone that has kept going for the past 4 years. Some apps these days crash on it from time to time but that's just because they've all been updated to support the newer versions of the iPhones. However the phone itself works perfectly fine despite me tossing it around on carpet, on hardwood floors, banging around with other things in my purse, and throwing  it at the wall when I get angry at other things."
7609,Great phone. Fast and has lots of apps for many different things in life. Battery last pretty long if you take care of it. Camera is pretty average for the technology. Still work something second hand if you upgrade 
7610,I don't like that with every update storage space is lost. And it starts out with less storage to begin with. Also if you have it too long it will crash constantly 
7611,"Worked great. 
was fast. 
great connections 
battery lasted long
long life span
didn't break easily."
7612,I have this phone for myself the husband has 6s and he wishes that he kept his 4s. but the only way i am giving up mine is if it ever breaks
7613,This is the best phone ever. Had an android before the iPhone & I will never go back! 
7614,"I would not purchase any iPhone that is not their most up to date product. They have upgraded a lot of things on the new phones; therefore, even if you got a 4S for free, it would be worthless. Companies are trying to give them away because they even know how bad they are. Service is nowhere near the service on the new phones. Plus most iPhones will start disabling you from doing things, like downloading apps, because the phone is not updated to the most recent updates. Even though this phone is unlocked, which means you can hook it up to any company/service, it is still not worth the time or any money unless you are just desperate to have an outdated phone that MIGHT work."
7615,"I bought this phone for my mom. She is very pleased with it, she said that everything works great. Loves that she can elimate the need for her iPod with the phone, and the camera works great."
7616,"IPhone 4/4s are very slow ever since the newest iPhones came out. Some of the updates with some apps do not apply to this phone. For example: Zoom on snapchat is not on this phone as well as the other newest snapchat filters. besides some apps that don't work with the iPhone 4s, it can still call, text, and FaceTime like any other iPhone."
7617,"I love my iphone. I love the imessage that i can use with family and friends that also have iphone. This is my trusty gadget and i take it with me everywhere. it is also a good size for my hand, pockets and purse. "
7618,Loved this phone. I have recently updated to the 6S but lost it so I had to use my 4s. The only problem is that with time it has started freezing and takes me to the home screen for no reason. It could be that  its old 
7619,"Purchased this phone for my 65-year-old mother and she loves it! It is a bit dated and we'll be upgrading her soon but for now, it's great!"
7620,I love my phone I have  always had a iPhone and I love them so much I would never go to an androdi
7621,"I like this phone quite a lot. Its easy to use, like the lightweight size. And the sound quality is good for phone conversations and listening to music. It's a good phone. "
7622,"Mines just a 4. I like it but I'm not really satisfied, I don't like how there's no filters for snapchat and other apps requiring iOS 8. Preferably wanting a 5s or 6"
7623,"Good product, I love the simple graphic of the Apple/IOS system, it's really easy to use for everyone of every age! "
7624,I loved this phone......... Will always choose apple for my phones. Could definitely use 64gb 
7625,I like it but I wish I got more GB on it. Its pretty sturdy I dropped it a few times and it didn't brake
7626,"This phone is just what you expect from Apple. User friendly, simple controls, good sound quality, and not a terrible price either. It's not the newest phone out there but it is still a good phone and I am happy with it."
7627,Great product. Keeps up with new iOS. Awesome battery life. Screen has never cracked. Would buy again.
7628,Its to easiest phone to learn how to use and so many apps you can download and great amount of storage! 
7629,Love the white color. Works just as well as any other smartphone. Great features and easy to use design. 
7630,"I love iphones, I always have. The home button finger print does not work as well as it should, and apps do glitch. The camera is inpeccable and everything is accessible. "
7631,I've had this phone for a few years now and it keeps freezing on me and shutting off but like I stated it's a few years old
7632,I really enjoyed this phone. The size is just right. Especially for fitting into small clothes or purses. I still have it and use it to store music. 
7633,This is the phone that I most recently replaced with a newer iPhone. I had it for several years and considered it a reliable friend. 
7634,Used to have this phone. It was a great phone while it lasted and it was pretty small and great. 
7635,Had it and absolutely  loved it until the IPhone 6 came out and the software update that came out turned my phone into a brick and I was forced to buy a new phone!
7636,"This is an okay phone to give to your child as their first phone. It is very outdated as of now , but it still works with all their latest updates."
7637,"Only iphone ive ever purchaced that the screen ever shattered. And i got the iphobe 4, 4s, 5, 5s and now i have the 6! Its was byfar the best iphone for screen quality"
7638,I just recent upgrades from my iPhone 4s I held on to it for years I dropped it so many times and still no cracks! Most reliable phone 
7639,"The best experience and i can use with my macbook Pro and iTunes, really the best phone ever."
7640,"Love the memory space, however the cloud gets full very quickly. My calendar is used daily- I love it! Love the accessibility of apps. Not a huge fan of the music app because of the new layout. But, overall it's a pretty great phone!"
7641,I love apple. Every iPhone I have owned is Apple because of the 4s. I have only had minor problems like glitches in the phone but never anything that needed fixing. 
7642,"Awesome phone would choose Apple over android any day display, speed , reliability everything is better"
7643,"My old phone was a 4s. Its a nice phone, but very small and heavy. I prefer my iphone 5s"
7644,Very user friendly. Great camera. Does not freeze. Just enough storage space for music and photos. 
7645,This was my first iPhone and it is fantastic. Small and light. Thicker than the newer ones. It has a great camera and works very well even though it is 5 years old. Great phone! This phone made me never want any other phone ever. 
7646,"This was a great phone, but there was not very much memory storage in the 16GB. This just showed me that I needed more storage."
7647,"I don't have a unlocked one, but I have a AT&T iPhone 4s. It is a good phone, sometimes can act up (considering the apps/storage) you've used it can run a little slow, or a app may freeze, but other then that I haven't had any issues! "
7648,"I've had this phone for about 4 years and have dropped it on an average of 3 times per week, and yet it is spotless. It is very sturdy and has never crashed- my favorite iPhone yet. Even though I got a 6S now, I have not been able to part with the 4S. I recommend getting the 32GB (at least) since quite a bit of the space is taken up by updates . It takes quite good photos and is the perfect size to fit into your pocket or purse. "
7649,"Good standard Apple product. However, now that mine is getting older it has been shutting off. Especially when the battery is at 30% or below or its in a super cold environment."
7650,"I really do love this phone, however the battery life is not great and it's an older model. "
7651,The iphone 4s was my favorite iphone of all time. The iphone6 had glitches. The iphone 4 lasted me well over 2 years and was a good companion! 
7652,Very buggy. It got hot quickly and would shut off a lot by itself. I didn't enjoy this product at all.
7653,"Honestly out of the phones ive had (i had probably 5) this one worked the best. I had a iphone 5 before the 4 as a temporary and i had the choice of keeping the 5, but i still kept the 4"
7654,Good phone. Easy and user friendly. Good graphics. Compatible with other apple products. 
7655,Very good phone for beginners and I love the fact that it's so small and portable
7656,I use the iPhone 4s for my work cell provided to my by my employer. For personal use the galaxy s5. I highly prefer the galaxy line over iPhone. The iPhone is much smaller and harder to customize but it is easier to use. 
7657,"I love my Iphone 5s. Love the color, Apple Green color. With 32GB, I more than enough storage for apps and music."
7658,"Got it when it first came out so
It was the cool thing to have Siri and stuff. Internet was pretty fast. Pictures were okay. Siri could use a little bit more working on. Actually the first 4s i had fell on the glass part and caught blue death. Had to get a new one. "
7659,5c  blue 8gb love it it's no black berry but I still live this phone and what I can do with it
7660,I had a good experience with this phone. I would recommend to other people. was easy to activate.
7661,The computer is Simple and easy to use. I think the accessories expensive but durable. 
7662,Still working good! Getting slow! But will keep using it. Cause I don't want to do an upgrade! Wish I didn't have Verizon contract! But will be out soon 
7663,I love my iPhone! I will never go back to android. I haven't had any problems with my phone freezing or turning off randomly. 
7664,"My husband still uses this iPhone. It is a bit outdated as far as its outer appearance but uf you're in the market for a great phone that is still up to date with its technology, then this is a great option! I have the newest iPhone on the market, (iPhone 6s Plus) but I will never go outside of Apple. I love my iPhone! Definitely the BEST phone on the market!"
7665,"Got slow after a while. Good phone lasted a long time and good as an iPod now. Although the power button, volume up button, and home button all broke the rest was good. "
7666," I purchased a black  16GB iPhone 4S, and for years I've used Android phones, and it was hard getting use to the Apple.  I got a great deal on my Apple 4s,  and got my son one, which he loves.   I myself am not too thrilled with it, especially coming from the android family of phones.     I do like the gorilla glass very much, because I have dropped it numerous times, and it is still intact.       The sound/ringer on the phone seems to this day,   on it's own turn the volume down, I constantly had to check and raise the volume on it.     I no longer have the phone, as I gave it to my husband, but he has had the same problem with it.   

I did like the  dual-core processor and and for it to have only and 8 megapixel camera, it does take awesome, clear pictures. I also like the features  of Siri, which is a voice assistant heeding natural-language questions and commands, and taking dictation. Other features of this smartphone include a gorgeous 3.5-inch high-resolution display, full web browser, Bluetooth compatibility, music player, WiFi, and 8GB of of internal memory. 

 I didn't like the fact that Apple store, basically charges for apps, that I could get on Google Play for free.    My husband likes it, and he doesn't seem to want to upgrade, so all in all, we are satisfied customers. 

"
7667,"It's an older model but works fine.  Internet access, camera, can play games, listen to music.  Has many capabilities.  Can download from the Apple Store."
7668,"I have had one of these for 4 years before and bought another because I liked the quality of apple products. Did not upgrade at the time because of finances. However, I wish I was able to because the screen is too small as I often had to take pictures of my professor notes on the board at some occasions. "
7669,Not too bad for only 50$ kinda slow but it was a good phone and very sturdy 
7670,This was my first iPhone and I fell in love with it. It was 4s and the first S ever meaning that it has Siri. Didn't use it much back then but now I do 
7671,"My first iphone! It made me fall in love with the apple. practicality, versatility and thousands of commands that could have in a single device facilitated my life 100%!"
7672,I love all Apple products! I bought this one after my old smartphone broke! Of course I'm looking to buy an updated version in the future
7673,"I live my phone! It is responsive, the camera is good, and it is small enough I can carry in my pocket. I just wish Apple would follow the technology from other brands"
7674,This was my first iPhone and I totally loved it! I let it go and I switched to Samsung but now I'm back with Apple!
7675,"This was my ""starter"" iPhone and I loved it. It's so much better than android. I'll never leave Apple now that I've experienced an IPhone. "
7676,Works beautifully for an older model. Easy to use. The  camera takes great pictures. The size is perfect;it can fit in a pocket
7677,"First Apple phone, even though I put it off for years being ""anti-Apple.""  It was so easy to use!"
7678,Avoid Verizon and sprint is my advice. Avoid the iPhone 4S and 5 as there are known issues with both types.
7679,This cellphone is like gods gift to mankind. I can stream all the bad videos really fast if you know what I mean ;) 
7680,I recently switched from an android to an IPhone because mine met an untimely end. I absolutely love the camera on the IPhone as well as the battery life.  
7681,"It was a great phone, for a long time.  However, with iOS updates and app updates geared at newer technology, it became bogged down very quickly.  In the end, it couldn't handle the technology geared at the iPhone 5 or 6. It would spontaneously shut down and battery life became abysmal.  Time to upgrade to keep up with incoming technology."
7682,I love all of my apple products. My 4S was a wonderful phone! The only problem I ever had with it was that the glass (both front and back) were very fragile. I had to replace my screens 4+ times in 3 years.
7683,Had the 4s when it came out and this was my first iphone. ill never go backt o anything else. Apple makes the most superior products
7684,"Love the iPhone. Compared to the newest, the screen is small, but the over all phone is great ."
7685,"I like that it is smaller than most smartphones. It is a bit heavy. Mine is slow, but that may just be because it is older or needs to be updated. The camera isn't great compared to newer phones, but that can be expected."
7686,"I like the shape of this product. The square shape is easier to grasp. The screen was decent before apple came out with bigger, better screens."
7687,Amazing phone. I love the camera on this phone it takes clear pictures and videos... I want another one.. I recommend this to everyone 
7688,"Guys this bad review has nothing to do with apple! My review has to do with Sprint. This is the worse mobile company in the word, the staff is not qualified, they don't bring solutions, everybody says something different. They are not reliable and will lie to get you into a contract. 
I wish I knew before entering to that store. Stay away from Sprint! "
7689,I loved my iPhone 4.  One of my all time favorite cell phones. I still have it and use it now and then. 
7690,"I loved this phone so much! I am now using the iPhone 6. But I had the 4s for almost three years. And let me tell you... I went through two screens. But, this was after I dropped it multiple times and it still worked perfect after o replaced the screen. AND. I ran this over with my car and although the screen shattered the phone was still working perfectly!  "
7691,"Love the apple phones and technology they have, I don't use many apps on my phone but they have some cools apps and the camera resolution is great"
7692,The iPhone four s is one of the best phones I've ever had ! It's fast and very reliable ! Not to mention keeps great charge .
7693,"Vey user friendly and appealing! The iPhone 4 is a great product. From Imessage to FaceTime, I never have a problem with any of the apps! I also love the definition of quality from the camera!"
7694,"I loved my iphone! It worked great for me for 2 and a half years and then it started to get buggy but considering how fast technology becomes outdated now, I was impressed!"
7695,"Always love the Apple products and this phone doesn't fail the expectations I had! I love it as much as my macbook! Very simple to use, customize and program. Amazing camera, and great quality calling! Speaker phone works GREAT. No muffles or break-ups"
7696,Apple make the top products. I really enjoyed this phone and found it to be a very reliable product. 
7697,"Me lo regalaron hace un año para mi cumpleaños y hasta hoy es el mejor smartphone que he tenido, puedes personalizarlo con hermosas carcasas además en color blanco es mucho más femenino . Nunca me ha fallado :)"
7698,"The easiest phone to use and to manage. With the latest ios it does slightly slow down and freezes your phone. This was my first phone, I still have it is great condition because every times I have dropped it it always landed on it side. "
7699,Very good iphone and very easy to use. Probably one of the better phones ive had....................
7700,"This was my first Apple phone which I had about 4 years ago and after my first year of using it, I passes it on to my mother. She still see the exact same phone and we have had no need to repair anything on the phone. Of course, the processing speed has lowered and the phone is quite slow but it has lasted 4 years. Also, the phone is quite sensitive and my mother ends up butt-calling me quite a few times!"
7701,"I LOVED my IPhone 4, I went through like 3 of them. I didn't get a new phone until the iPhone 6 came out. Still missing my iPhone 4 :("
7702,I love Apple products; I would like to upgrade soon to a larger more up to date phone but this will do its very portable and i love it. Anything Apple actually I love. 
7703,I love me some iPhones!! I will never get another brand. They are so easy to use and understand. Screen is just the right size
7704,"Very thin compared to previous models, but you get used to it. Easy to use as all apple products are. "
7705,"I liked this phone a lot when I first had it, it was just time for an upgrade!"
7706,"I will never own anything but an apple phone, I love them and to me there is nothing better than a iPhone "
7707,"Loved my 4s at the time, it was the most advanced electronic item I had ever used. I have used other brands of phones but none felt as easy to use. "
7708,This iPhone is way better than my android. This phone is fast and it has space. I recommend this phone.
7709,What can i say apple is bae... one of the best brands next to samsung .... love the picture quality and the memory
7710,"Very outdated now, however it once did take amazing digital photos and worked well in terms of watching videos, texting, calling..... but since the newer iphones are out Apple no longer updates these older iphones."
7711,"Loved this phone, but I ran out of space quickly. Had to empty pictures when uploading to computer and had to change music out because it could not hold my whole library."
7712,"You can't use the phone, text or data service without a plan, but you can use everything else. Phone will pickup wifi and run apps as normal. 
We ended up buying this instead of an iPod for our younger kids. Has all the same features as an ipod, plus all the features of a smart phone without the talking and texting. 
Should keep them busy for awhile! see less

7713,"I used to have a 4s but I upgraded to a 6.  The 4s was perfectly fine, I just upgraded for a new phone, a bigger phone. I'm still happy  with  the 4s and would be fine switching back"
7714,I love evrything apple we have had iphones since they have been out. Now i am using a samsung a i really like it
7715,Love my iPhone. Could not live without it. Love the storage capability and FaceTime functions
7716,Smartphone is a smartphone not APPLE is the best from the rest others will never compare High quality 
7717,"This is the first smartphone I've ever owned, and I love it!  It is so nice to take pictures and video wherever we are and connect to 3G when we need directions on the road!"
7718,"This is by far my favorite iPhone. I didn't like the 5, the 6 is huge, but the 4s is my baby. I used it until they no longer supported most of the apps. 

I had it for over three years with no technical issues. Definitely a solid piece of technology. 
"
7719,This phone was very durable for what it was. I had mine for 4 years. I always kept a life proof case on it though. 
7720,I love the iphone. I am a lifetime user. I think the 4S was my favorite. It was a good value.
7721,"I don't know what I would do without my iPhone, I use it for organization, alarms, calls, and texts!"
7722,Had this for 2 years do not waste your money just switched to Android so much better this phone lagged so bad the battery went in the first 6 months & the updates required so much room there was barley any left for pictures & apps I feel as though the iphones are one of the biggest scams now. loving my new galaxy s6 edge.
7723,I absolutely love this phone .  I love it so mush that I've refused to upgrade it several times.  
7724,I used this iphone it was allright but came out more iphones. Now i owned my own iphone the is 6S white silver.
7725,"Phone was good, but even 16GB of memory seemed to be taken up quickly. Also cracked really easily. "
7726,I have a IMac compure and a iphome. Love the computer and love the iphone the only problem I have with iphone it takes trouble pixs.
7727,"Love my phone! I've had it for a few years now, and I won't give it up! I can talk, text and email all at the same time. It's an easy to use operating system as well "
7728,I love my iPhone would not leave home with out it or purchase any other brand.
7729,Great smartphone just wish it had a bigger screen! It lasted a couple of years before it started giving me problems. 
7730,I really really love my Apple phone. I like how the Facebook app works better on an Apple than on an Android. It works really really well and I love that I can actually find cases for this phone. The only thing I don't like is how long it takes for it to update when the updates come through. 
7731,I love this phone a ton. still with my cracked screen and even thought theres newer models I'm still madly in love with my baby
7732,We have had this phone for over 2 years. just starting to have problems with volume and charging now. 
7733,"Great performance and resolution.  features are adjustable. for fun, pleasure or business. a unique iPhone. you wouldn't want to leave home without it. . Its good for office use and travel. easy to conceal."
7734,"When I bought my iPhone 4s it was the newest model of the iPhone and was the first iPhone I purchased. I loved it so much, my only regret is buying the black instead of the white, but that was just personal preference. I have since purchased a 5s and 6s model (both in white) and they just keep getting better and better. I'm an iPhone user for life!"
7735,I liked the iPhone because of all of the apps and things. I did not like the size and how bolky it was when you put a case on it. 
7736,"The iPhone 4 model is obviously a little out of date now and it's difficult to get the newest apps or updates, but this is still an amazing phone with a great user interface. "
7737,"I love my iPhone! I have to say I'm an apple fan! But any model of iPhone, I do trust! Old to new, all great :)"
7738,"Very good cellphone and comfortable for use ! The software is totally different from android but is unique and original idea 
"
7739,Its a good device when its new... But after a while the battery starts dying fast! Its not good 
7740,This baby held it down for a while! Make sure you update it frequently or the system will slow 
7741,I had this phone for 2 years and loved it until it glitched so I had gotten an lg
7742,I just got rid of this phone but I still loved it when I had it ........ It just ran a little slow because of it being old but other than that it's nice 
7743,Love the apple phone. Don't like the androids!!!!!!!!!! It would hard for myself to switch phones 
7744,"I HATE IPHONES!!!!! The only good thing about it was the amazing was the memory. Other than that it sucked it froze all the time, it would barely connect to the WiFi, and the battery life sucked big time!!!!!!"
7745,"His design is only and the model is partial, his white color to make it see mas elegantly and his space of storage of memory hospitalizes and for external memory adaptable ahce to the today technology."
7746,This was my first iPhone and it got me hooked on the brand. They held a decent amount of music it was the perfect size
7747,"Held up great for almost 4 years, I did have to replace the screen once but other than that it has never failed me(:"
7748,This is a smart phone that works great and can do most things a tablet can do but i cant give this phone a good review bc the battery life is horrible plus the screen is way to delicate
7749,"This iphone worked pretty well, and covered all of my basic needs. However, eventually the screen started to mess up and I could not get on apps, as well as it would shut off and not come on when I tried too turn it on. It was never broken nor was it dropped, but eventually all phones mess up."
7750,Not the best phone in the world it's very slow  and you can't update it when you need too 
7751,It synced perfectly with my iPod and macbook and never had any dropped calls. It's a little bulky but even if it's an older model it continues to update the operating system and works well.
7752,Favorite iPhone yet. Size is perfect and the camera is awesome. When taking pictures and you go back to look at them they move.. I have it for tmobile  
7753,"Great phone, easy to use, good size to fit in my pocket you know the only reason I upgraded is because it was time on my contract."
7754,"My first smartphone. I loved it. iOS 6 ran beautifully on it. 7 and up were laggy and bogged down. 
This phone was amazing, it lasted 3.5 years with no issues until the battery starting going. "
7755,This is the first iPhone I had and I have a different one now but this phone was a little slow but it did the job and was there when I needed it 
7756,Great product! I love my phone! Would highly recommend it to everyone!! I've always used I phones!!!!
7757,"Although the 4S is fairly an old release from Apple, it's yet to fail me in any need that I may have. It always gets the job done, reasonably quickly, and is reliable. "
7758,Love it. The battery lasted the whole day. Easy to understand. Beautiful exterior design.
7759,I did not like the 4s because of the all glass back. It was prone to shattering 
7760,"I used this phone for a few months, and I personally think Apple is a great product, although this phone was kind of slow. Its too old for the newer apple software that is required to download to use certain apps. "
7761,4 of us have an apple phone it is so easy to use and has so many features that we are all enjoying
7762,"IPhone 4's are honestly the worst iPhones out there by far... even androids are better than this. the back crack extremely easily, they are slow with no storage, extremely small, and have horrible camera quality. I upgraded to a 5 and it's the best decision I have made"
7763,I've had this phone in the past. The only phones I use are Apple. Easy to use. I love the product and would recommend to everyone.
7764,Really great. Sold mine for a 5c but it worked great. I got it for a first phone and it was amazing
7765,"I had it for a short time,about 6 months I think.It was very good at the begginging,and then started to crush and become a very slow.I also hate first version of iOS so whatever I wanted to install,it could not because it needs better version of iOS."
7766,I love my phone. At first I was quite skeptical about it but once I got to know it and learn to use it better I fell in love
7767,"This was my sons first phone, and he loved it. Simple use and always reliable "
7768,This is the phone i am using. Its perfect with the features and handy. its amazing to work with this phone
7769, I really hate this product it's a horrible pictures and the features were not as good as the galaxy
7770,I love toss phone I actually need to update bit over the update install I works great
7771,"I enjoyed this phone for the time being until the 5 came out. It's pretty durable, dropped it quite a few times and didn't do any damage - thankfully. Sometimes my phone calls would randomly drop, thought it was my service provider but turned out there was a glitch in the phone which had recalls. Over all, an okay phone. 3/10"
7772,Recently bought the iphone 6s plus 64gb in silver and i absolutely love it. go for the bigger screen with the plus--you will not be sorry. Within a few days I have gotten used to the screen size and will never go back!
7773,The 4s is a nice phone for what you get for it. It is smaller than my 6s and 5s but it has a lot for a small phone! It was the first front facing camera I experienced and I loved it. There was a decent amount of space on it for apps and photos. 
7774,Didn't love this product. At the time when it first came out I was so happy with it but over time the software upgrades made it slow and it crashes often 
7775,I mean really Iphones are a defenite staple and i cant live without all the apps it has to offer
7776,"It's nice , I prefer my 5s better but there isn't as big of a difference . I like the programing and the look of it . its absolutely beautiful"
7777,I love my iPhone's. But 16 is NOT enough space. It's ridiculous how little amount of picture and videos I had but was constantly being told my memory was full. I didn't even have one full screen of apps either. 
7778,"This IPone 4S is the third iPone I have. It was very useful and  easy to use. The only issue is the memory, 16 GB is quickly used and I have to store my pictures and delete unused apps frequently. "
7779,"DO NOT GET THIS PHONE. It's so tiny. So crappy. So OUTDATED. If you're looking at an iPhone but wanna save some money, wait for the newer versions to drop in price . The 4s is definitely not worth it. All of the system updates are basically useless now, phones too outdated for most of them"
7780,"Absolutely love my iPhone 4s when I had it, with the exception of not having enough memory so I upgraded to a 5s and recently went to a iPhone 6S+. Apple is the way to go people!"
7781,I have the iPhone 6 and i love it! I like the bigger screen and it looks a lot better. Photo/camera quality has improved. i am currently waiting for my upgrade and ill be getting the iPhone 6 +
7782,Reliable phone but due to new updates runs and little slow and jams occasionally 
7783,My old phone was an iPhone 3-6. My grandson loves his Wi-Fi phone to play his games on.
7784,This is a good phone but the newer versions are better but it still has IOS9 so thats a plus 
7785,"I used a white iPhone 4s for about a year. Although it served its purpose, it had a couple problems. For example, the battery could never keep a charge, no matter what I did. On top of that, the glass front and back, although pleasing to the eye and touch, was very fragile."
7786,I had mine through ATT! I love the iPhones! I will probably never use another phone. My only problem is that there never seems to be enough storage!!! 
7787,I had this phone for years and it worked well but near the end it was very slow. I wouldn't recommend buying this phone now as most apps or upgrades to apps won't be compatible in the near future 
7788,"Although it is not so updated iPhone has many features and is very comfortable , excellent to start learning to use the Apple brand"
7789,"I had this phone a few years back, but I loved it. I had a few issues here and there with the power button which stopped working, and it did start to run slower nearing the end of my contract. Other than that I loved this product, I will forever be a person who uses Apple."
7790,"I love my phone!!!!

The quality of my pictures are great and every time my phone rings I know that's my IPhone!!!!"
7791,Ive been using this for 5 years already and its still alive and gives a good service. very very good quality
7792,I think that it's the best iPhone. I haved one and now I gifted it to my sister. Is an excellent smartphone. 
7793,If you never had an Apple IPhone you're missing out. As much as they come out with the new updates and the easy access with these iPhones it's the best cellphone you could have!
7794,It's okay! The phone works well and they are good about keeping up with the updates. Only problem is how fragile it is and that it doesn't have free music downloads 
7795,"Works good, picks up WiFi awesome, great front and back camera, has a loud speaker and awesome signal "
7796,I love my iPhone can go without it I love the different features and I can easily download new programs
7797,"I have used this phone for a couple of years now. I am telling you there is nothing wrong with this model except maybe if you want a larger screen. This phone is handy and does everything, internet use is not a problem on this phone, and the signal strength pick up almost never goes out. The battery lasts a whole day even if I'm on it the entire day. The iOS always updates itself (if you set it to that) and you can get almost all latest apps to old apps on this phone "
7798,"One of my first Apple products. Loved it, super easy interface. So easy to use and never had any technical issues. "
7799,"I loved my 4s but unfortunately broke the back as I dropped it , upgraded to a 5s and am still happy with the iPhone"
7800,Never had one but I would love to. It's Apple who wouldn't they are the best brand ever made by man. 
7801,The 4s sucks. I love my Apple iPhone 6. It was the best thing ever invented and now I can't wait for the Apple iPhone 7 to come out. 
7802,I don't like this phone I prefer the Apple iPhone 6 it is soon much better than the 4 I would recommend the 6 instead. 
7803,Like the size of this phone. It's easy to use and keeps me connected with ease. Compatible with my other apple devices 
7804,Love my iPhone 4s! Super convenient and love the size. Has everything I could ever need in a phone. 
7805,The lock key on top for these phones are horrible. They get stuck and then ur stuck having to pay to fix it or get anew phone
7806,This was a pretty good phone I didn't get it when it barley came out I got it way after it was popular I had many phones and they would just not work for me until I got this they are greats phone not that many people have them but they're really good. 
7807,"In my experience, Apple products have a great interface but break way too easily. After just under two years of use, my phone battery began to die at 65%."
7808,I've had the phone since it came out and it still runs smoothly. The only issue is the space. We all need more space than 16 gb. The camera quality could be better but that's why the new phone came out. 
7809,My second iPhone. It seems that with each generation they keep getting better. The battery life on this was stellar. It lasted a long time. 
7810,"Great phone, but I would suggest buying a higher memory capacity if you use your phone a lot. Texts, pictures, and music adds up quickly!"
7811,Really great phone compared to the older models.. Easy to use and great memory storage to star with 
7812,Great phone for a beginner. Easy to use with bright graphics. Can adjust text size as well. 
7813,"I have had this phone for about 6 years. its so durable, i don't have one scratch, looks brand new after all these years. the battery and speed of the phone is starting to suffer, due to the updates and doesn't have a lot of storage space."
7814,At the time it was the best thing since sliced bread however since the 5s has come out it is drastically slower. That being said as the times go on there will always be upgrades to be had. 
7815,Great iPhone. Probably the best phone I've ever had. I love everything about it. My only complaints are the weird glitches that Apple products often have but these are nothing that I can't live with.
7816,Great phone lots of good apps 16 gb which is enough space for games picture apps but out of date
7817,This is really outdated than the iPhone 6 and is very slow would not recommend 
7818,"The Iphone 4s is okay. If you buy this phone, you will have to update it to the new IOS. Basically it will leave the phone slower."
7819,IPhone 4s is my connection to the social media world!!! Easy to navigate and lightweight. White seems modern and sleek. Love using Siri!
7820,Love my iPhone and will definitely upgrade to another iPhone shortly. Can message and talk my kids and friends all over the world  with iMessage and iChat.
7821,I had this phone for 2 years. It was my first iPhone the screens crack way to easily on th
7822,I bought this for my significant other and he hates it. It's not nearly as fast as my iPhone 5c and it takes bad pictures. It wasn't worth it
7823,"These phones, although cheap are incredibly outdated. It is because of this that they are quickly becoming harder and harder to keep up with apples IOS system."
7824,This has been the best phone for me. It's been though hell and back with me. Love my phone 
7825,Love the phone. Still learning how to use it. It takes great pictures and has a lot of storage space. I would recommend it. 
7826,I was scrolling and selected the wrong phone. I used to have this phone and l loved it. I still have an iPhone just a newer version. 
7827,"I love my phone has many features that help me through the day 
I like to check the weather daily and use the GPS a lot 
love the note pad ... I have lots of notes "
7828,I have had this phone for 2 years and when I do decide to upgrade I will stick with Apple for sure. 
7829,"I loved this iPhone, it was so much more sturdy than the new ones. I dropped it a million times and it never broke. My boyfriend had his for 3 years before he got a new iPhone..I now have a 6, and I like the new features but I miss this size. "
7830,I had a go phone so everything was limited and it would freeze most of the time.
7831,"I am team iPhone, all the way. I love this phone. It's easy to use and navigate. Takes good pictures compared with other phones released at the same time. I love Siri as well. "
7832,"This was, by far, my favorite iPhone. It was completely white and rectangular.  I never had any technical issues with it."
7833,Do not buy this phone anytime soon. Apple has long gone forgotten this and it barely works anymore. Too slow and too many bugs.
7834,It lasted me a very long time and was a great phone. The only issue I ran into with it was it would run out of space.
7835,Loved the iPhone 4s  was a brilliant wee phone only changed phone because I upgraded 
7836,I had my iPhone 4s for 3 years and was seriously the best phone I had ever owned! 
7837,"Always and iphone lover.  Ups the game as expected. Not a dissapointment. It is a little long, but you get used to it and forget what the older iphones were like."
7838,I had the iphone for a couple of  months and i loved it but it had its flaws. I felt like it just ate up the chargers and the battery wouldn't last long... customer service wasn't that helpful and they were always rude 
7839,I have had an apple iPhone for the last 5 years. This product is great. I wouldn't choose any other brand over Apple. They always satisfy.
7840,I was impressed with the iPhone 4S but there were some glitches with my phone. Of course I felt it was time to upgrade but I am truly #teamiPhone!!! 
7841,"Great phone, just very breakable. I am very clumsy with phones, so I dropped it and the screen shattered. "
7842,"I love my iphone! I have so many apps that I use daily. I love checking my social networking apps, and many others. I always have my phone in hand Although my camera is not the best.  I am still team apple iphone all they way! "
7843,It's my 2nd iPhone. This phone is slow. Doesn't have a lot of good apps n can't be updated without buying a new phone
7844,I love this iPhone so much! I have all apple products but had a Samsung phone and it was horrible and would crap out on me every year and I'd need to get a new replacement! Finally got an iPhone and it's everything I could want 
7845,Great phone! Have not had any problems with mine! It works great! But hopefully soon will get an iphone6!
7846,This phone was great until it started freezing and shutting off on me. I'm not sure why it did this due to the problem I upgraded to a 5s
7847,"This phone was okay. Mine often froze up and the battery drained very quickly but the phone itself was very durable considering I dropped it a few times. I had it for nearly two years and still have it now as my back up phone in case I ever have something happen to my new iPhone 6s. I will forever have an apple phone, laptop, ext.. "
7848,I have an iphone 5c white 16gb now but when I did own the iphones white 16gb was perfect for my everyday use.
7849,I have always enjoyed the iPhone that apple sells.  It's the only phone that my 3 kids will use....love it
7850,"Good reliable phone works just like an iPad easy to handle, good while charge you can use iCloud to save things"
7851,"I prefer the iPhone 4 to other models because it always holds its battery charge, and I like the size better than the newer models."
7852,I love apple product is in general.  This phone is a great phone however it is smaller and a little thicker than the newer iPhones that are available. Also the lock button on top seems to have more issues than other versions of the iPhone. 
7853,I have not purchased any of the items that are listed to choose from. So I can;t failrly give a review. 
7854,"This is my 4th Apple iPhone and I love it.  The size is perfect, the storage is perfect, the color is pretty and feminine.  Just love it. "
7855,"This was issued to me by my employer, Disney, when we got rid of our Blackberrys. A really nice upgrade. I was able to keep iMessage open as a means to communicate with my boss and other managers... I could easily call for help on duty calls and my spouse had a way to reach me. Always reliable and easy to use."
7856,"I used to have this model and loved it.  It is small and compact, which makes it easy to carry in your pocket.  It's a little slower than new models, but all in all it functions well."
7857,"I already almost broke my oldie phone, but it's been two years and a half since I have it and I love him "
7858,"I loved this phone when I had it, but it's very outdated now! I have loved every apple product I've owned!"
7859,You can take it to any carrier. This phone is amazing I have no problems at all. I love it!!!
7860,"Great iPhone. Has good volume, camera and everything!!nice looking cell phone. Smart is right!!"
7861,I love my iPhone. I do not have a computer or a laptop at my home so I use my iPhone 4 for everything from shopping to my social media. I shop a lot too! 
7862,"I have had this phone for the past 3 years and its been alright, but I am so excited to upgrade.  It is alright and freezes up all the time"
7863,"Both my husband and i own these phones, everything about it is awesome, the camera is great quality too."
7864,"I remember I had this for a long period if time, not the best investment I made. It was a little block. Small screen, but very customizable. I would find cases for a dollar anywhere and everywhere. I wouldn't go back to this though. This would be a phone you'd get if you want to save money for a new one. This would be a temporary phone. "
7865,With all the new versions this one sucks. Apple comes out with too many new phones while making the older ones shitty. 
7866,I loved my iPhone so much! I really miss it and plan to buy myself one for my birthday. I had the 4s before I had to buy a new phone. I can't wait to have an iPhone again.
7867,I just simply love ALL APPLE devices I feel that apeople is one of the best electronic device stores ever
7868,"Great! Enough space for personal apps. I love that feature because there's not a lot of bloatware like Android phones.
It's small enough to fit in my hand and listen to music, and just almost the right size to watch videos.
What I dislike about it is that:
1) all the apps have to stay on the screens or in a folder
2) although I love simplicity, I also feel that it has no customization at all (besides wallpapers)
3) there aren't that many good cases for it."
7869,"I loved my iPhone 4. First of all the white looks super pretty, sleek, and elegant. I had mine for 4 years before I upgraded to the 6. My only complaint is that 16 gigs is too little. Most phone companies don't even offer 8gb is so ridiculously insignificant,so Apple really needs to step that up. Other than that the phone is great. "
7870,I looved this phone never have i gone back to any other kind of phone apple is the best love my iphone even upgradded it after the 4s 
7871,Love the 4s wish I still could have mine! Was the best phone hands down. Not to big the perfect size 
7872,I love my iPhone it works is easy to work and I have had an I phone since iPhone 3.  I love the picture quality
7873,Apple is my life. I love all things Apple. This phone is perfect for someone starting out with smartphones and they're always reliable and pretty sturdy too. 
7874,Bought this for my kids to play games on for Christmas and they are great got them refurbished 
7875,"Overall I liked my 4s. However, the screen was small in comparison to the new phones so it's harder to use. It's also not compatible with a lot of new updates."
7876,Had this product before the phone I have now and I really like the 4s it was a very good phone 
7877,My favorite one because it was my first phone. It was so easy to learn how to use and was just the perfect size
7878,Well this was the first phone I've ever gotten and it has to be hands down the best purchase I made at that time. 
7879,"Apple phones, to me , are the best on the market. They are great quality and really multi-useful. I picked to review the iPhone 4s because, in my opinion, I enjoy smaller phones."
7880,"The size of this phone is good, but it is thicker than all of the more recent versions, which does make this a heavier phone. "
7881,I use to have this phone . Is just like a normal iPhone which is . AWESOME. I just love apple products lol
7882,Okay let me just say this IPhone is the love of my life I can not live without my cellphone
7883,I absolutely adore this phone I love the 3d touch that works a lot better than using two hands I would recommend this for all Apple users this is not a downgrade it is absolute upgrade love this phone
7884,"I'm incredibly loyal to the iPhone, not necessarily the Apple brand in general, but iPhones specifically. I generally have no interest in other smartphones as only ever replace my phone with an upgraded iPhone. So why 4 stars instead of 5? Because I recommend investing in the iPhone with a higher memory. 16GB is the smaller memory, and you'll breeze through that before you know it. Our lives are on our phones these days, and it's something you'll use everyday, so to me it's worth it to spend the extra money on something you're going to use so frequently. Cost per use makes it worthwhile. Besides, if your phone is always out of memory, that's something that's going to annoy you on a daily basis."
7885,"I like this phone it is the best. i love the amer and what not it is the best i love love love it
"
7886,My first iPhone. I've been a subscribed of Verizon for years and will never switch.  This helped introduce me to the world of Apple.  No problems at all with this phone when I had it and I traded it in for the 5S after two years when I came across a deal that was too good to pass up. 
7887,My daughter loves her apple products and cannot get enough of them.  She never complains well besides the flimsy screens they are constantly breaking and cost so much money to fix it's insane
7888,"Es un buen teléfono, tiene buena capacidad, el diseño me gusta, puedo traerlo en cualquier lugar y tiene muchisimas aplicaciones"
7889,"Worked will till I broke, found better when I come to photos and pubs less problems then the new iPhones "
7890,Ive had my 4s for about 3 years i hated to depart from it!  I loved the design it lasted years I still have pics and messages from it that i was able to save in the cloud.
7891,"The iPhone 4s was my first iPhone and I loved it. Have been using iPhones ever since this one.  
"
7892,"Apple 4S was my first iPhone ever! I remembered wanting the White one, but it was sold out even though I was on the waiting list. I paid $50 in advance to be on the list, but I ended up with the originally Black phone. "
7893,"Slow because i have one of the old ones but good sound quality just slow software everything works slow Instagram,  Snapchat the internet everything"
7894,Great phone just a bit outdated. it has a great amount of storage and the picture quality was pretty great considering the fact that it was a much older cell phone
7895,"Surprisingly, I still have this. It does get the job done. Picture quality isn't great and everything runs a bit slower compared to the newer devices but it's small and I can still text and call so I'm okay."
7896,Would give 5 stars but 16 gb is just not enough memory.      Photos take a lot of memory!
7897,"Great IPhone, had my one for years! Fast internet, still works great! Only con is that it isn't compatible with the new Snapchat features."
7898,"Buen celular, rápido, inteligente, útil y muy fácil de usar, tiene todo lo que necesitamos. Tiene muy buen sonido, muy buen almacenamiento y seguro."
7899,Great phone however sometime is quite slow and can have poor battery. Overall a good company 
7900,I have an iPhone 6 purchased through Verizon. I love Verizon and I love my iPhone best quality and service. 
7901,"This  phone is the bomb!!! One thing I don't like about it,it freezes up sometimes,but all I have to say about it is,it's a great phone"
7902,I like how small it is compared to the new releases. I also like that Siri is included.
7903,"Het is een leuk gsm, handig
maar het glas breekt  snel en het blokkeert ook vaak
en de prijsje is wel
"
7904,"I've been an iPhone user since 3G iPhone, and when iPhone 4s went out for sale, I bought it and it has been the best model so far. The size was perfect, it worked very well, it was fast. The pictures were great. "
7905,Very slow because it is not compatible with other iPhone products such as the apps. It is a bit heavier than the newer iPhones. 
7906,Not very durable. I liked it. Battery was okay. It helped me with social media and directions that's really all I used it for
7907,"I loved my iPhone 4S. I liked that it had Siri and I didn't have to use google so much. I enjoyed my 4S so much when I had it that when it was time to upgrade, I stayed with apple. "
7908,"What's Not to like about Apple products , I've been buying apple products for years and it never dissapoints me 
"
7909,"I have this iphone and I'm really in love 😍 the apps are amazing and this ios is super fast, I never change my iphone 😍"
7910,Had this phone for what seemed like forever. Always been a smart phone Apple type of girl anyways. The best phone if you're into a million apps like I am. 
7911,"This is one of the best iPhones I have had. iOS is super easy and very user friendly 
"
7912,I love this so much. I only use apple products so this was really a good choice for me. 
7913,I can't imagine leaving Apple for any other smart phone. Fits my needs professionally and leisurely 
7914,I've had iPhones since the first generation and I don't think I will ever buy anything else. When it comes to smartphones in my opinion nothing is better than the iPhone. 
7915,Love this phone. So fast. Small. And I've yet to experience a virus on an apple peodyct
7916,Just like any other apple product this has not let me down. Love the white especially! 
7917,"I used this phone for several years. It worked well until the end once it was a few years old. It then began to slow down, drop calls and not always receive test messages. I upgraded to the iPhone 6 and love the function but do not care for the size. I prefer the size of the 4s as the 6 is too large. "
7918,"I love this phone the camera is amazing. The memory is amble so there is more than enough room for what i love most, pictures and music!!"
7919,"Eception para el iPhone 4S fue en general favorable. Los revisores observaron Siri, la nueva cámara, y velocidades de procesamiento ventajas significativas con respecto al modelo anterior. [13] [14] [15] Fue sucedido por el iPhone 5 como el teléfono estrella de Apple el 12 de septiembre de 2012"
7920,"Basically a computer, phone and camera in the palm of your hand. I am a devoted Apple customer and swear only by them when it comes to phones, tablets and laptops."
7921,"I love my iPhone. I used my husbands Samsung Galaxy 5 for a few months while I waited to upgrade my broke iPhone 5 to the iPhone 6 and I hated it. The only features I wish the iPhone had is a ad card, it would just be awesome to have that and easier.. I also hate iTunes for music downloading but  I still think the iPhone is better than any other phone. Also Samsung is supposed to have a better camera but all the pictures I took with my husbands phone were grainy and looked bad but the pictures I take on my iPhone are always awesome."
7922,"Great phone! Way better than any of these new iPhones that have been coming out lately. This phone was extremely sturdy and even with my constant use, it lasted almost 3 years, much longer than more recent iPhones have lasted for me."
7923,Great phone!  It is what turned me on to apple products and I've been a fan ever since.  The ease of use is what every phone should be like.
7924,I love apple and all apple products! Never any hidden files when downloading and I love the design and the layout 
7925,This phone isn't that good ots super slow and doesn't work well the youtube app also isn't that good at all on the phone 
7926,"I have the 16 GB Space Grey Unlocked version. I have never been a fan of iPhones and this is my first one. Let me be honest, I only bought an iPhone because i could not find a good replacement for my previous HTC One X+. As someone switching from the Android platform, i had a lot of trouble copying my contacts and photos. Having to depend on ITunes etc to copy music to my phone puts me off. The battery seems to last ok..nothing to write home about for someone who does spend a considerable amount of time browsing on my phone. The photo quality is good and the iPhone makes life easier if family and friends are also users of Apple products since Face Time and Air Drop features are very convenient. 

Overall would switch back to Android the next time i am in the market for a new phone. "
7927,"First iPhone I owned and it did me well. Lovely photo quality, the best of the best. "
7928,"That's my actual smarthphone... I don't have any negative comments about it, i just ️love it since I buy it... I ️love iOS and apple "
7929,Was a really good phone. Love the volume mind lasted a long while. Still have it but switched phonea
7930,"Este es mi telefono por los momento me encanta, he podido utilizar todo perfectamente! La bateria me dura y es resistente a los golpes.

Es rapido y la memoria es suficiente para mi. Tengo 5000 foto y muchas apps. He podido actualizar hasta la ultima version de iOS pero si que cada vez que actualizo el telefono se pone cada vez mas lento."
7931,My first love! One of the best platforms thanks to the easy user settings. My 2 year old nephew can even use this! Yet it can be customized and has so many amazing apps for content creators and more advanced users! I love all my apple products!
7932,"I had one a Few months ago and had problems with the signal, but then i bought another and worked very well"
7933,"Great, durable phone, screen is very strong. Fast. Great with Internet speed. Good software."
7934,"Current 15-inch MacBook Pro owners won't feel the need to upgrade, but the handful of tweaks included here keep this expensive system at the top of the list for powerful midsize laptops."
7935,"What is there not to love about apple stuff, everything in my house is from apple, I can't live without it."
7936,This smartphone never went bad on me. Always worked very amazing I love this product I will continue to get apple products
7937,The smartphone does its job but the it is quite slow and you can not download certain apps as it can not have the latest ios and the speaker is quite lowin volume
7938,My iPhone is great I love it! Sometimes because it's a 4s it's a bit slow but over all a great phone!
7939,My lifesaver. Can't leave home without it. It helps me stay in touch with friends and families all over the world. And easily can share pictures and videos. 
7940,Where do I begin these are the best phones ever. I don't kno what I would do without mine they are great. Everyone should have one
7941,I love my phone. I use it for everything and like all the different apps I can get.  I never leave home without it.  I don't know how I ever functioned without a phone before 
7942,Apple smartphone products are my favorite! I had to get a new 4S every 6-8 months because the glass screen shatters easily. 
7943,"Definitely wouldn't recommend anyone buying an iPhone4 in this day and age. It is a severely outdated model and not worth the money compared to the newer models, such as the 6."
7944,We all have smartphones but the kids have the apple iPhone which they love. Good reception 
7945,It has the best camera but it drains very quickly and gets hot very quickly. You should splurge once on apple products but shouldtnt invest on buying every apple product one is enough just invest on other good devices
7946,Loved it but I'm the kind of person who gets tired of it and wants something new so I now have a Samsung but it's perfect for a phone and it lasted me a long time 
7947,It is the best of the iPhone's to date. I currently have an iPhone 6. Returned an iPhone 7 plus. Wish I could continue forever with the 4. 
7948,I for the most part like this phone. It's my first iPhone I've ever owned. It does have a few things that need foxed
7949,I love my Apple iPhone 4s! Never had a problem except my screen cracking after dropping it! 
7950,"I just loved, and missed :C was a really great phone and nice software, easy to use and manipulate"
7951,Great phone! Only problem was it just randomly stopped working. No explanation . 
7952,Slooooow and so many issues do yourself a favor and get a 6! Also very clunky.
7953,Too basic and the screen was not of very good quality although the design of the phone itself is nice. 
7954,"For as old as this phone is, it is still kicking and working wonderfully! I expected it to fail out, but not yet!"
7955,"Love my Iphone, like a little laptop with amazing features such as Camera, Video, App's Galore, email access, internet, etc. Been using Apple Iphones for over 5 years, will never which! Addicted. "
7956,"I've been using the iPhone for 6 years now, and will never go back to Android. It has a lot of customization but not so much to feel overwhelming. It's fast on the processing and never lags up. The photos I take are crisp, and clear. "
7957,"Not enough storage for apps and music both, haven't been able to transfer much music onto it. System is outdated as well and cannot support things like the fitbit."
7958,This was a great phone when I had it back in the day! It was a lot sturdier that the beer iPhones!
7959,"I love
My
iPhone. It was awesome and I enjoyed using it. It was simple and helped with my every day actions. I planned and worked of my phone daily. "
7960,"This phone is great because it can still keep up with the new iOS and it runs great. For LTE users, it is outstanding because the speed can keep up with new iPhones. "
7961,"Great phone at the time, but quickly became slow with new iOS updates. Had it for my entire 2 year contract with no complaints"
7962,The iphone 4 isn't too bad. i just like the 6 better because its bigger and thinner😂
7963,It's old size for storing in your pocket or clutch. It was a great phone for me while I had it but I upgraded when the 5s came out. I love Apple IPhones❤️
7964,I have had this phone for about 3 years now. I just recently upgraded to the iPhone 5s because if I did and IOS update to my iPhone 4 it would get very slow and stop performing basic functions . 
7965,My most favorite iPhone of them all! This was the most indestructible iPhone ever made. 
7966,The apple iphone works  good as long as  you have enough gigs. I may need to get another one soon.
7967,It is actually sometimes very slow to load but also sometimes so quick and it charges very fast and is easy to use.
7968,"I absolutely LOVE this phone! I originally had an Android which I also loved but when I started my new career my new employer covered our phone expenses and our email security works best with Apple. 

I took this phone to Europe with me and dropped it while ascending to the top of a historic cathedral... All that was damaged was the glass screen protector! 

I have also (shamefully) dropped it in the toilet.... After two days of sitting in a bag of rice... Works like nothing ever happened! 

Two thumbs way up 👍👍 "
7969,"I absolute love iPhone 
I love the camera it has 
Love Imessage 
I also love FaceTime 
Love the size of the phone "
7970,My old iPhone still works even though the 7 is about to come out soon. It's a little slow but it's updated and works fine. 
7971,Love everything Apple has to offer m. Way better then android. The features an camera are just amazing. An way better app options 
7972,"My first iphone and it lasted through water damage, multiple drops and broken screens! I only upgraded to get a better camera and because my battery wasn't holding power for very long.....no complaints other than that! I upgraded to another iPhone. iPhones are great and I recommend any of them. "
7973,It's a great phone. If you want the quality of an apple device without the huge price there honestly isn't that big of a difference to me between the 4 and 5 with the updates it almost has the same things. I love mine!
7974,Works great for a while but after a few months the battery life is much shorter and takes longer to charge
7975,"I had this phone and it worked perfect. But if you still use it don't do the new updates!! It makes the phone super slow and not work properly. Also the camera compared to the new phones isn't very good
"
7976,I still have this phone 😩 BUT it still works fine and is a solid product! I would still recommend it to people. 
7977,I still have this phone 😩 BUT it still works fine and is a solid product! I would still recommend it to people. I would recommend any apple product!
7978,"This cellphone is old, but i really love it! It is very updated and the model is really beautiful! I still have it "
7979,I love iphones. I recommend the 4s 16gb if you need something inexpensive and its still a good phone. 
7980,"My daughter has this phone, I have Apple 5s, She loves it, i have checked it out, and there is not a whole lot of difference. The charger is different. There were a couple of other minor things, that i can't remember, Overall you have the same great Apple functionality, which is awesome. This review, is coming from an originally die-hard Android user. Once I tried Apple, that was all over with. I am n official Apple Fan."
7981,"Great phone, has lasted me 3+ years, battery does die quick now but thats expected with the amount of time ive had it "
7982,Need i say more? love apple devices such a great tool to have i love that i can do so much with this life is simple
7983,"What can i say that you don't already know? This phone is unbelievable. Fast, light, pretty and with the best apps in the market. Buy it now¡¡"
7984,"This was my first smartphone and I honestly had no complaints about it! I got it when I graduated high school and had it for two years. By the end of those two years it was becoming slightly obsolete in terms of software updates, and I was also running out of space. So if you want a phone that's up to date and with more memory and newer model might be better. "
7985,"This fone was a really good companian to me. I will never forget the relationship i had with my baby. It was a good phone, a little heavy but when i needed you 'you would always light up my world'. To  those who are considering buying this fone, i say BUY UP BUY UP. you will love it yo :)"
7986,"My iPhone is probably the only thing that keeps me sane sometimes! I love the calendars and alarms that are so easy to set. I recommend it above any other smartphone! It has such a simple, easy user interface that anyone can navigate. "
7987,It worked super well when I had it 2 years ago. The software is extremely outdated now and doesn't work very well. 
7988,Started out with this phone had no complaints now i have passed it on to my 4year old
7989,Good iPhone but the newer versions seem to be better I know have the iPhone 5c and  the 4s is a lot smaller and does not run as fast at the other iPhones 
7990,"The phone lasted for 3 years, then it started to act up. The function of the phone was quite slow as it got older. In terms of camera quality it was good. All in all I highly recommend the IPhone 6 and up."
7991,"It's a good phone , has a nice quality .keeps it battery long enough even for having it 2 years . still works A1"
7992,I purchased a iPhone 6 and changed my provider in the process of the purchase. I really like the iPhone because I had already had a iPod so it was easier to understand the features.
7993,I Hate It I Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate ItI Hate It
7994,Love apple. Love iPhone. Super easy to use and learn anything you need to do on the phone. Easy to find everything 
7995,First smart phone and i am beginning to like it. it is convenient to have everything all in one place
7996,I enjoy having anything I need at my finger tips.  Battery last is decent and charges really quickly. 
7997,"No it's not as fancy as the newer iphone models but it works just fine for my needs. Great product, lots of great app options."
7998,The upgrades on the camera are good. There are a lot of software updates and I don't like the recent update on how to edit photographs. It is very complicated
7999,"Apple is a solid product. It is my only choice when it comes to cellphones. I like things to be practical and simple and using this iPhone feels this way. The only thing that I dislike is constantly having storage issues. If you take lots of pictures, I suggest getting a phone larger storage capabilities. "
8000,"I had this phone for two years before upgrading and never had a problem with it. Even though it's an older model, I would still use this phone. "
8001,Love my iPhone 4!  Would dream of upgrading to a 5 or 6. My iPhone has so much more memory than my husband or daughters!
8002,I've had it forever and I love it..will.be upgrading soon to a iPhone 6 cuz its about that time
8003,"Apple is my favorite brand. I love their smartphones, iPads, Laptops and Computers. All designed beautifully and so easy to use. "
8004,Love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it 
8005,Loved my Apple IPhone 4s.  I have upgraded since owning this phone but have stayed with Apple because I was so happy with this phone.  Never any issues and had many useful features. I'm forever an apple customer.
8006,Good phone. Not enough storage... The phone is becoming very outdated and may not compare to new phones on the market.
8007,I love IPhones. I have been using them for years. Its the only phone i use. This time i bought the one with biggest memory so i can store more photos. 
8008,"Eception to the iPhone 4S was generally favorable. Reviewers noted Siri, the new camera, and processing speeds as significant advantages over the prior model.[13][14][15] It was succeeded by the iPhone 5 as Apple's flagship phone on September 12, 2012. The iPhone 4 remained in production, albeit being sold with reduced storage (from 16/32/64 GB down to 8 GB.) It was officially discontinued on September 9, 2014, following the announcement of the iPhone 6 but is currently supported as of iOS 9. However iPhone 4S is still being sold in some countries at low prices such as Philippines. During the course of its lifetime, the iPhone 4S is the best-selling iPhone ever produced and it is the first iPhone to support five major versions of iOS: these being iOS 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9."
8009,Durable phone. Was decently fast even after a few iOS updates which tend to slow older iPhones down.
8010,Most definitely a lot cheaper than the higher up iphones. Still has great quality and comes with Siri!! 
8011,I had the 4s from Sprint and I loved the iPhone but I didn't like the reception that Sprint. It was so pricey for an awful service. Sometimes I wouldn't even have signal at the movie theatres. But the iPhone 4s was awesome so cute and small lol 
8012,"You know you have a smartphone when you have an iPhone, no matter which model is, iPhone is iPhone. I hope soon upgrade my device to track the innovations they have created .
I used the Samsung Galaxy S3 for a long time , went to repairs on several occasions and the truth is that my iPhone, although it is a bit dated, it is kept in time and operating through the system that supports updates iOs. Was the best investment."
8013,Loved my iPhone 4s! It still works and my mom uses it now. Really great phone. I like that everything is laid out and easy to see and use. 
8014,"By far the best phone i have ever used, the only thing is i think i should have bought one with 64GB of RAM"
8015,I still have one right to this very day. I know that everyone had already advanced to the new iphone 6s but I still enjoy it soo much. The world is quickly changing and for a person who doesn't like buying new things unless they break  then this is the phone for you!
8016,I wish I had a newt one this one is out dated doesn't work well and I alway have to get it fixed I do not like this phone at all
8017,I always wanted a I phone and I'm quite pleased with this one. I can do so many things I love the health apps.
8018,I loved it. It was my first iPhone and it lasted forever. I won't be going away from Apple anytime soon. 
8019,I loved my iPhone 4s.  I love how easy everything is with it.  Its super easy to sync up with my macbook .  I love it so much that I had a 5s and now I have the 6s
8020,Some people says that iphone 4 it's crap but mine it's been 1 year and everything is fine so if you don't really have a big budget take this 
8021,"I love my phone, I use it for work as well as personal. never had any problems with updates and icloud is the best app for communicating and saving my files"
8022,This phone is great. It functions well and makes everything I do more efficient. Really happy the this product and would recommend to a friend.
8023,It dies very fast and I don't know why iPhone are so popular yet I follow the trend. The screen cracks very easily. 
8024,I have used an iPhone for about 8 years now. This new one does not dissapoint. 
8025,"I am super excited to have an iphone finally.  I just bought it today,so I cannot provide any super helpful information.  But it seems nice"
8026,This phone was with me when i was in college and the pictures are really awesome. there is also great storage      
8027,"I used this product for 2 and a half years and never had any problems! Towards the end before I traded it in, the home button started to become less responsive but that's normal wear and tear for all iPhones. "
8028,"Not bad, better than the 4 but not as good as the 5, love the os, easy to use and operate."
8029,Once you start using the 5s and 6s you find apple iphone 4s was a horror story hehe jk.   
8030,"Best phone on the market. bad thieves think the same, the battery and the memory are horrible"
8031,"A melhor de todas as marcas na minha opinião, não troco por nenhuma outra. Fácil de usar e pratico. Eu amo!"
8032,Always upgrade to apples newest phones. operating system is always the same which means it is always good. i like the slimness of this phone. 
8033,I have had about 5 iPhone 4 s and they never let me down . Camera isn't that great now that I have a more updated phone 
8034,Good Quality. It freezes a few times but overall great buy if your looking to have a reliable smart phone
8035,Awesome phone. cant say enough about it . 100 percent recommend it . great quality .Well made. 
8036,Loved my iPhone 4 before I upgraded everything worked great till the last year I owned it ( I had this puppy for yearssss) the phone would shut off by itself  and need a charge but I would honestly recommend this to anyone 
8037,"I'm not a huge apple fan, but this phone is great. It comes with a nice size memory. love the features and the size. "
8038,I have had this phone for many years. It has been a decently functioning phone. The data storage capacity stinks. I get an alert all of the time that I have not enough storage to take a photo. My apps now crash all of the time because Apple stopped supporting my phone over a year ago. I wish they wouldn't do that as it renders the phone totally useless and worth nothing.
8039,Had to buy a 4S when I laundered my 5. The 4S would probably have been perfectly fine if I hadn't already had a 5. The 4S was much slower in launching apps. 
8040,I love this iphone!  Camera quality is great and Apple continues to make products that are consistent and user friendly!
8041,"Apple is the best in everything...phone is good, nice looking, girly , everything i wanted."
8042,"Oldie but a goodie! When my old phone stopped working I was looking for a cheap replacement and I found a great deal on an unlocked iPhone 4S. I was so pleasantly surprised by how wonderful this phone is, especially since it's a few gens old now."
8043,I've had this phone for years and it still works perfectly. I refuse to even try another phone. 
8044,"I had this phone for 2 years before switching to another iPhone. Going from a blackberry and android beforehand, I found this device to be very user friendly and the lay out is very easy to get the hang of. Since switching I would not switch back to anything else."
8045,This was my first smartphone purchase and I totally fell in love with Apple. I just wish I had opted for more storage!
8046,Great phone but got so slow once the newer versions came out. Still use it as an alarm clock and great for simple tasks when using wi-fi
8047,"I love my Apple iPhone! I feel connected to everyone and everything that is important to me. All the apps I need are preloaded, but if you need more they are easy to get in the App store."
8048,I had a black iPhone 4s that was 3 years old and the battery just wasn't working anymore. I got this new white iPhone 4s and it's exactly what I wanted. I love the 4s size and using iOS 9 hasn't given me any issues at all. 
8049,Love the phone.  It is easy to call people in your call list if the phone is not locked.
8050,My husband and I both have these phones. They are really great. Only thing is you have to be careful doing the apple updates. They turn on certain features that use up all your date but other than that it has great features. Does everything you could possibly want a phone to do. 
8051,"I've moved on since having the 4s, but I had one for about 2 years and loved it. I'm an apple fan for sure!"
8052,"I get Apple mobile phone since they exist. No matter wich number (serial product) you you get at the end. Obviously try to be up because technology runs fast. But coming back to the 5s model just say that it was the apropoiate of 2010/11 period even 2012. These gadgets have an incredible durability and are the easiest of managing with. And its design its that, real smart design and functional, elegant. And the outcome of the every year improvement the product is for giving more usability and faster work with it, apart from many other advantages like the battery, the new marherials that make it product to be wore of its price. And if you get it unlocked by Apple directly so much better. You feel real independent with it. And can do almost everything with it. I recommend it without hesitating."
8053,I'm a long time Verizon customer. My White 16G 4s was a good phone. Slowed after a while but I had it for  2 years until a friends dog knocked it out of my hand & the phone still worked but the screen had permanent blue lines. Upgrade to the 5c 32G
8054,LOVED this iPhone.  I had it for over 3 years and I never had any trouble with it.  It did everything I needed it to do and more.  The only reason I even upgraded was because my screen broke.  
8055,Loved the phone for about a year then after that little glitches kept happening and finally a complete melt down
8056,"This is the first iPhone I got and I am fell in love with it, it is really a good phone back then"
8057,"Muy Buena marca muy buen celular, pero a mi en lo personal no soy muy amante a este celular ya que me lo encontre un poco complicado en cuanto almacenaje y me limita un poco en cuanto a las aplicaciones. Pero esta marca tiene su gran publico "
8058,This was my 2nd iPhone purchase. I love it and it was easy for me to use. It has so many options for free apps any more to buy if you choose that option. I have since upgraded to an iPhone 6. 
8059,Love this phone!! Perfect size and I'm a huge fan of apple products and this phone doesn't disappoint! 
8060,"Have loved all on that phone, but memory is small for me. good phone, good design. This is a great simple operated phone great for people who aren't great with technology or a young teenager's first phone.
"
8061,"Iphones are spectacular I love, its technology is amazing always try to buy estamarca so good it has been for me, highly recommend it, it is a quality team, very durable and great service."
8062,"I wouldn't trade this phone for the world...when it first came out. After having it for a year or so it became SUPER SLOW! the battery life is terrible, and you can't get the cool new updates for snapchat. If you want an iPhone I would recommend at least an iPhone 5."
8063,"I have this phone at the time, even it is 2 gens, back it still is intact, has fallen like a 100 times and never broke any part or the screen. is a great phone, to me, the best one they have made so far. still works fine and I am not thinking of getting the new one for my self, my husband got the new one, is a little brighter and the volume gets higher, but the 4 is still a great iphone."
8064,I had this phone for 3 years and I hated this phone! I was behind on 1 upgrade (iOS) and I wasn't able to upgrade it to any other ones! 
8065,"LOVE my iPhone, only downfall I had was I ran out of space for photos! Kept deleting photos to take more.."
8066,"My first phone! These things are literally beasts! My phone lived through all the drops and every bad thing it went through, it was a trooper. I never had any of the fancy shockproof cases or anything and never had to get it replaced or fixed at all. Although they are old and a thing if the past, I would still recommend for a first phone for a teenager. "
8067,"I absolutely adored this phone before I upgraded. It was incredibly user friendly and a great ""starter"" smartphone because it's so easy to navigate. "
8068,I have this phone and I love it! I use apps on it all the time and I like how it includes the weather as well as texting and emails. I will continue to purchase Apple products because they work really well and they are easy to learn!
8069,"I hated it so much in 2015. Everyone had the 5 and I still had the 4s. It stunk because it glitches out so much. The camera quality stunk and it was so small. Don't get me wrong, I was happy when I got it in 2013, but after a year of having it I was annoyed. The only good thing about it was that it never cracked."
8070,"I love the function and size of my 4S - I don't like how big the smartphones are getting now. Because I like to accessorize, I am finding it hard to find cases for the 4S as it is an older model."
8071,All apple products are amazing! I love how this one is so small and you can just put it in your pocket and not have to worry about it falling out. 
8072,This iphone is great i used it for 6 month and i love it.  Its kind of small but you can do anything you want with no problems.
8073,This phone lasted me a a long time and never died. I even dropped it in the toilet and it still worked. Truly invincible. 
8074,I have a iPhone 4s and I have to say sprint is not the best company to go to at all there customer Service was terrible  go to Verizon !
8075,I like this phone but the only con is that the camera quality is not so great.
8076,"I love my apple, i don't think i could ever switch brands. I love all apple products very user friendly"
8077,Great phone I have been using iPhones since forever and right now I have the iPhone 6s which I love
8078,Had an iphone before worked good but not a lot of space ): i personally love apple products though.
8079,This was my first smartphone and I did absolutely everything on this phone!  I loved being able to use FaceTime and Siri.  I take a ton of pictures and download music and hardly ever ran out of memory!  I would recommend this phone to anyone!!
8080,"This was my first ever iphone, and i fell in love with it. dropped it a gazillion times with no cover on it and it never got messed up,. Was really a gem"
8081,First iphone i owed. Very easy to use. Never froze on me very nice picture quality. Forward facing camera could have been better
8082,"Obviously not the latest or greatest iphone, but the 4S really does hold up on its own even after all these years. My camera, OS speed could use an upgrade but this is still a great smartphone. "
8083,"This was my favorite iPhone ! I wish they still made it, However I need to upgrade to the 6"
8084,I had an iPhone for 4 years already and it great I like it but whooshing to have iPhone 6 Plus 
8085,"I have tried other phones but always find myself coming back to the iPhone. I love the easy navigation, available apps and how well the phone runs. "
8086,"Great phone, I am such an iPhoneista!!!! I couldn't function with out my iPhone "
8087,"This was my very first iPhone and I really like it, I have an iPad so it was easy to get used to using the iPhone, there are only very few  minor things I had trouble with but with a little research online, I was able to figure it out pretty fast."
8088,I hate it . There is absolutely no storage at all. The service with Verizon is okay but not for what you pay every month for it.
8089,"
I love my iPhone , I love the operating system you have, and all about what the virus has no way of other smartphones"
8090,I love my phone it's so easy to use. I can text quickly and open apps so fast. I love it 
8091,Love this phone! I had the iPhone 4s for about a year before upgrading to the iPhone 6 and I do not have any complaints. 
8092,"I have been using my iphone 4s over 3 years. At beginning I really think it is a good phone, but now I need to charge 3 times a day. Since it is still working I forgive it. "
8093,"I loved my iPhone 4s. I loved everything about this phone from its size, down to the hardware but Sprint as a carrier, NO THANKS. Even if they paid me to be a customer again, I'd pass. "
8094,I used to have an I phone 4 before and it was pretty good and very useful I really liked the way that that iPhone looked
8095,This phone lasted me a long time. I have nothing but good to say about this phone. 
8096,This phone takes great pictures and has good storage. Really nice screen display and.....
8097,"My kids each have this phone and they love it! Large screen, great apps. Only complaint is that they are took expensive."
8098,"I personally love all apple products, very easy to use and love the way iTunes works, definitely a lot easier than Samsung products "
8099,"Love my iPhone! I'm able to connect the Bluetooth to my car and all I have to do is say ""Hey Siri!"" "
8100,"Buen teléfono o bueno, smartphone, Apple no defrauda, aunque algunos no les guste. Lindo!"
8101,"No lo he adquirido, pero considero que cualquier producto de Apple no decepciona, por muy ""poca"" memoria que tenga."
8102,"La verdad es compré un Iphone 5C pero aquí no me dan la opción, pero en un muy buen teléfono."
8103,I LOVE my phone! It's been there for me through it all. The memory did run out pretty fast. I've had it for almost 3 years and there is not once scratch on it. What I love about iPhones are the cases. They are so creative and personal.
8104,"The iPhone 4 (regardless of your cell phone carrier) works best if it has a case. There was some issue with the iPhone 4 and the quality of the internal cell phone antenna. Without the case, I drop from full reception to only one bar. I had the same exact issues when I owned an unlocked iPhone 4 which I used with T-Mobile. So I highly recommend also purchasing an external case, to protect your phone as well as improve the cell phone signal."
8105,An iPhone is an iPhone is an iPhone. The camera is terrible but you don't notice until u get a new phone lol 
8106,"Fue mi primer iPhone me gustaba mucho por el tamanho y el
Modelo es perfecto,  la camara sale bien
Para ser de ese modelo. Me gusta mucho todavia lo uso. "
8107,"LOVE my iPhone. So much more dependable than any android phone I've ever owned. Fast, great look, tons of free apps."
8108,I have enjoyed my iPhone 4S. It was the first Apple smartphone I have purchased. I used to only use Android phones. I would recommend the iPhone to anyone.
8109,I love my iPhone 4 and the way the pictures look is incredible.I would totally buy it again because i messed up mine.If there are any offers or so i can receive it in the mail i would totally be down to get/receive it
8110,I know that the 4s is older already but I love it so much! It was my first smartphone and I hope my next one can compare
8111,Me encata este telefono muy buena marca execelente programa la aparincia es muy elegante
8112,Just bought a iPhone 4s about a month or so ago and it was brand new and I hated it cause it randomly stopped charging. Not very happy with my purchase. 
8113,It works really slowly  but the camera works fine. So i guess i recommend it if you need a phone.
8114,"I love it but the picture quality is better on higher ophones  but i love the color and upgrades
"
8115,I absolutely love this product!  I have never had a problem with my iPhone and plan on upgrading to a newer version 
8116,All ways love app stuff it just so good with every thing the look of the phone & everything thin at on it the apps 
8117,"Overall I really enjoyed the phone while I had it. I kept it up until I broke the screen. You can get them very affordable now. The biggest problem I had was battery life, always had to have a charger. "
8118,"I love my 4s so much. :) It has lasted almost four years, which is the longest I've ever had any cell phone. Runs smoothly, battery lasts a day or two, up to date on apps. A+++"
8119,Love apple products. Just upgraded to a within the last 6 months.  I use to have an android but once I upgraded to the iPhone - I never plan to go back
8120,Who doesn't love their iPhone? I mean come on! The best apps and cool graphics! Not to mention amazing multi platform technology  
8121,"I had a very experience with this phone.. 
The battery would die very quickly on me "
8122,"I have the iPhone and I love it . I didn't see a reason to upgrade . Unless it breaks . But I'm fine with a smaller screen and without the 4g Lte . It's pretty quick , love the design and it's easy to use . "
8123,"I love this phone, I've had Iphones for the past 3 years and I think they're just so easy to use.  They allow me to keep up to date on everything I need and are lightweight and portable. "
8124,"It's a good phone but after awhile I couldn't update it, after a year or so I upgraded to the Ipone 6. "
8125,"I had an iPhone 4S for about 3 years before upgrading to the 5S. I loved the phone and never had any issues with it. Every update installed flawlessly and the speed and functionality of the phone remained the same throughout the time I used the phone, there was no major drop off in functionality with updates or age of the phone. "
8126,"Let me start off by stating that I used this phone for 4 years. It worked fine, up until the last year or so. Then, it would close out of an app while I was using it, die at 58% battery power, freeze, and randomly keep my texts from coming in. I also had issues with the low memory storage, and had to constantly delete things just so I could take a picture, etc. My camera was pretty bad quality. It definitely wasn't as fast as my friends' newer phones, but with a new battery and a higher storage capacity, I would get this phone again. 
"
8127,"I loved this phone. Although it was slow and didn't have a lot of storage for all the selfies I take, I must admit it was quite durable. I dropped it so many times and it wouldn't break. The processing unit was a little slow but all you need is patience! I would repurchase again if necessary."
8128,I don't really care for apple products. I am much more of an android person. The phone froze and often messed up and even erased all my music and contacts at one point.
8129,"I like it, I is small and it does have a small amount of memory but overall it gets the job done."
8130,I love I phones! they rarely ever mess up and they're very simple. the only thing I recommend is getting more GB on the phone. if you have a lot of photos it won't let you take anymore. 
8131,I love how great my iPhone 4s is. After three years I have had no issues or complaints! I can still get about two days out of the battery.
8132,Great phone and is not slow! I have had it for at lease 5 months and love it definitely worth the money!!
8133,I have had this iPhone for over three years and the battery still last two days without a charge. Love my 4s!
8134,The 4s was a great phone. I personally love the 6s because of the screens but the 4s was a great phone
8135,"Totally Unlock, can use any sim, plus brand new, fast shipping, all accessories included, usb,wall charger & earphones...5 stars on this!!!!"
8136,I love apple products I wouldn't use anything else they have such a user friendly data base and fun to use
8137,"I recommend this cell , I was very useful, the camera I do not like but everything else"
8138,Do yourself a favor and upgrade. The smartphones are getting too advanced for the 4s to keep up with. 
8139,Loved my iPhone.  I dropped it so many times how ever it's still looking like brand new. 
8140,"Its good because it lets you have the new updates and stuff but it can be really slow sometimes which really annoys me. also, i find it really dumb and annnoying how for snapchat it doesn't let you have the new face filters and the zoom for video but it lets you have the speed, slow, and reverse for video"
8141,"Honestly speaking, this was my favorite iPhone that I've ever owned. I liked the shape of it and how compact it was plus it withstands more drops that my current iPhone which is the 6. Only downfall is you won't be able to use current software on it "
8142,I love apple will never buy another brand smart phone but don't expect to get no more than 2 years out of this device
8143,After you use this phone for about a year it starts to glitch and throw you off the server. I have barely gotten 2years out of mine. 
8144,I had this phone for almost 4 years. Excellent and absolutely stunning. I would have kept it until it died except my boyfriend bought me a blue 5S for my birthday. Highly recommend if you buy this phone to get a silicone case rather than a hard shell case. 
8145,Not happy it is hard to keep charged. have a problem getting some apps on this phone. decided to go to another phone
8146,It was good before but thn not all features worked as I needed to upgrade my phone but I used it for three years and it was good
8147,I miss my 4s!!!! This was by far my favorite phone I've ever had and I still keep it to use as an iPod!
8148,This phone was great when i had it. however i recently used a 4s and with all the new updates it is very slow. 
8149,"I love my Apple iPhone. I upgrade to the next phone every time a new phone comes out. There is no better phone in my opinion. It is easy to use, takes great pictures and video and has lots of cool features as well as apps available free and at low costs in the Apple ITunes Store."
8150,This phone has little to no memory. You can't have a lot of apps and it dies really quickly. I personally have had a lot of issues with it. It's just not the best phone but that could be because it is older. Would be a good starter phone for kids/ teens. 
8151,Great product that lasted me for years. Aside from the the low GB count it was great to use for beginners.
8152,"I do not own an iphone.. but I do have an iMac since 2008. It has lasted me... Only once did I get a virus. It still works wonderfully.. The hardware it very lasting. I love that Apple has free software updates. Also, there's nothing I can't do on it. I can use microsoft and it is the same.. I even bought an iPad mini because of how much I love apple. I like samsung for my phone, but I if I had the money I'd probably buy an iphone.. "
8153,"Amazing phone, I love apple and as I went from this to an upgrade it was even better, very sturdy"
8154,"Had this phone for 2 years and it never ever caused me any trouble. Speakers worked great, wish I would've had more memory space but still awesome with the cloud. I miss its tiny screen, I feel like it was an appropriate sized screen."
8155,I have this specific iPhone and I love it. I've always been happy with Apple products. 
8156,Apple is the best brand for anything if you are intrested in something like this don't second guess yourself go get you one now 
8157,"Kind of outdated and a bit slow, but honestly I don't need any more and think it does the job well."
8158,I loved the 4S when I had it . Great phone . I was able to get all my apps downloaded.
8159,Loved this phone! The Verizon network was super dependable and the apple product was great quality. 
8160,I want a new phone cause this one freezes a lot and dose not fully work. So I do not recommend it 
8161,"This all in all is a very good phone. The only thing I don't really like about it is the small screen and poor camera quality. Yet, I will keep this phone as a backup to  my new iPhone."
8162,"This phone seems to contain a lot of issues within the system. You can update the iOS yet you can not receive what newer iPhones have, such as updating the emoji keyboard. I have to call to fix problems like losing my contacts, the phone constantly shutting off by itself even when it has a full battery. Overall the product is mediocre. "
8163,"Loved this phone had it
For years and would have again if I could woooo woooo will love love "
8164,"Great cellphone! Even though, the recent ones are better quality in regards to camera and processor."
8165,When I first got this phone it was great. Over time I noticed the battery would drain so fast. Now it hardly holds a charge. 
8166,IPhone 4s is the best just as great as any iPhone i really love these phone and they are worth buying..
8167,I HAD THE APPLE 4S IT WAS A GREAT START TO ENTER THE IPHONE WORLD IT TOOK A LITTLE TO GET USE TO COMING OVER FROM ANDRIOLD BUT NOW I AM A IPHONE LOVER TNR 
8168,"It was a phone it worked. The only reason I stopped using it is because I had cracked the screen and they had come out with the iPhone 6   
"
8169,"Great phone, old model so it doesn't have as many cool features as the new iPhones "
8170,One of my favorite iPhones until the 6 plus . Love the shape and size . I bought this as a back up for my husband .
8171,"My first apple phone was this one and since there I just have apple phones, I love it and I'm addict "
8172,Not as upgraded as the new phones but it gets the job done. Purchased as an extra phone for my daughter 
8173,"Perfect design.quick apps.resistant to falling,my baby has dropped it soo many times.i use it for taking photos and videos.i use it for vlogs gor my youtube vlogging channelbest phone i ever had"
8174,This phone was more trouble then it was worth .... we had many issues with it over heating and burning my daughter .  we got rid of it when my daughter was shocked by it. now she has an 5s and is having similar problems with it
8175,IPhones are good phones! Made by a awesome company and the 4s works great. Even know its not the newest one ! You know?
8176,I had this phone a few years ago and the lock button seemed to always get stuck and not work anymore.
8177,Maybe I am simply too much of a Droid fan but I am not a big fan of this phone at all.
8178,"Slow compared to the newer ones, and a lot of the newer games don't work on it"
8179,Had it loved it now I have 6s plus❤️❤️❤️  the 6s plus is better for me I can do more with this phone I love it😍have the rose gold one👍
8180,I want a Newer phone my phone always freezes and sometimes I don't even get FaceTime calls sometimes 
8181,Love my iPhone! I would never go back to Android after buying a new iPhone! My favorite phone!
8182,"This was my first and last apple product/iphone. I loved the functionality of the iphone but I hated the constant updates and worseover, the fact that you cant add a micro sd card. I had to pat $20 a month just to have enough space to ""back-up"" my phone on itunes!"
8183,"Had this phone for 2 years. It's great, the only issue is the screen can crack so easily from a single fall. Enjoyed it while I had it. "
8184,Had and iPhone 4s for 2 years and it was the best phone i ever had. Just recently go an iPhone 6s in rose gold and i am obsessed. Never switching. 
8185,This was my first iPhone and it was great but ran out of memory fast and then I was unable to FaceTime because I could not update my phone because I didn't have enough room so functions of the phone stopped working.
8186,"I love my 4S, worked great until a bought a Samsung. I missed so much my iPhone that I ended up buying another iPhone, this time the 6 and I love it"
8187,Don't love this phone. Slow and freezes a lot. So frustrating! Would not recommend this phone to anyone.
8188,The iPhone is all the same but it does its job just my phone got messed up and now doesn't work well 
8189,I loved this phone. I love how you can use Siri. The operating system is easy. I love how all of my information is stored on my I cloud account 
8190,I have used this phone since the time it launched until I bought the new iPhone 6 and its a great phone! I love all the apple phones!
8191,The best decision I have ever made! I love this Iphone 4S because its my first apple phone beside of the ipods and ipads.
8192,"It fits in the palm of your hand. It has Siri, and a better camera than the previous model I liked it at the time of it's release but now it's pretty slow compared to other phones."
8193,Love Love Love this but i really wish it had more space other than that its amazing.....
8194,The size of the phone is nice because I can put it where I want. I really like the colour white and how it contrast with my light blue case. the fact that this phone have 16GB drive me crazy because every time the phone tell me that I do not have enough space. I prefer the oen of 64GB but I am thinking to change it into an Iphone 6 
8195,"Great basic phone with lots of memory, I love this for my photos and music. I love the apps and simple layout of the phone."
8196,"I love this phone even after having it for almost a year and several software updates. The battery life is great, and even after dropping it twice, it's still in perfect condition. It's even missed the toilet by a meer inch! "
8197,"Came quick and in the ""original"" packaging. loved my old iphone4 before my job gave me a company phone. got laid off, went through another phone and 2 numbers before i went back to the (current) iphone4. only reason i give it 3 stars is because it is a refurbished phone (1 star off), and the home button slowly rotates clockwise (and 2nd star off). instead of pressing a squared off, well, square, it turns into a diamond, then back to a square, and the cycle continues. considering those 2 reasons, I'm giving this thing about a year before it takes a dump on me. i would have bought from the virgin mobile site again, but they stopped carrying iphones for some reason or another, so i resorted to this."
8198,"I love this iPhone. It works better than any of the previous models. The battery lasts longer, and the screen is durable. It's easy to hold and very thin and light."
8199,This phone saved my life. Now I don't have any problems for going on social media. I will never buy another brand than apple for my phone like never ever ever ever.
8200,"I bought this phone for my teenage daughter and she loves everything about it. It is very easy to navigate, but i have always used an android and prefer it. But nothing bad to say about this product"
8201,"This was my second iPhone, and I really felt like this was the largest step up in any of the iPhones I've had."
8202,Love this phone it does everything easy use has great protection. Love apple iPhones want to upgrade and try the new iPhone but money is tight...
8203,"This is the phone I had before upgrading. It worked well at first, but gradually begin to get slow and lose it's charge."
8204,I've always wanted an iphone and in white. It is a handy phone to have and use. I have all of my favorite apps on my phone and I don't go anywhere without it. It looks cute as well and can be matched with any outfit. 
8205,I personally have this cellphone. Its really great it runs all of the apps smoothly. The only downside is that after a while the batter life runs down very quickly but other than that I love my phone. Although the Iphone 6 is a fantastic phone. 
8206,This phone was nice when i had it but now is very out of date. not bad though if you are looking for something cheap
8207,"This phone lasted forever for me, I only hated t because it was so much older than all the other new iPhones, it's very fragile though, both sides are glass, definitely needs a case"
8208,I love this. I know it's not the newest... but it works great. I just got a new phone.. and I miss my Iphone 4!!!!! RECOMMEND. 
8209,Apple Computers Apple - iPhone 4S with 16GB Memory Mobile Phone - White (Sprint)  is perfecttttttttttttttttt
8210,Love the iPhone and use it for work constantly. Always have service and always works very well
8211,I love Apple products! This phone was no exception. Easy to use once although once I got past a certain software update my phone slowed down a lot.
8212,I have been an apple user for years. i have tried other brands but i always go back to apple
8213,"I love this phone it's a tank and it has really held up well over the years, sad that they quit updating it. :( "
8214,This phone is very and old. It is also hard to find cases for. But it Dosnt wrok good for not playing games. Also it works good for  listening  to music. 
8215,"The phone worked well on iOS 6 but anything after makes the phone get a bit slower. This was the first phone to get siri so that was exciting, and the camera was upgraded to 8 megapixels. A great basic phone but cant keep up with some of the new apps and games."
8216,"I bought this phone for my 11 year old for Christmas.  So far, I love it.  I have always been a Droid user, but this phone truly makes me want to switch!  Sri is so amazing and this phone is super simple!"
8217,"It is a phone. it takes photos, can listen to music and play games pretty simple actually. it works really fast first year and after about a year and a halve it will start going a bit slow"
8218,Basic smart phone. The camera is great takes crisp clean pictures. The phone is pretty durable.
8219,Great for beginners who want to try iphones! Easy to use. Great camera quality!
8220,"Personally the iPhone 4s is a good phone but nothing compared to the newer models! these old models cannot update apps, and software. "
8221,This is unfortunately the only iPhone I have used last I switched to android but am currently looking into the iPhone 6
8222,I currently still have my Iphone 4S. It works like any other iphone phone. I will be upgrading to the 6s soon though but for what its worth my 4S is still up and running and I've had it for about 2 years already.
8223,"I've had my iPhone 4s for three years and it still works like a charm, regardless of being dropped thousands of times and even being ran over by a truck! "
8224,Love this phone I feel like the quality is much better than the newer iphones but I do agree on the design of the new ones and how they are much nicer looking
8225,"My first ever iPhone! It was great for the time that it was brand new. After two years and updating software, it ran very slow, but that was only because of how phones were a few years back. Still a wonderful cellphone. "
8226,I really enjoyed the way the iPhone works but they're just way too fragile for me.  I was having to get the screen replaced every time it barely knocked into something. 
8227,Everything Apple is just amazing and flawless. Love these products. Would never buy anything else other than Apple. 
8228,"I use to have this phone it currently belongs to another one of my family members but it is an excellent phone, I had no problems with it "
8229,"I like my iPhone 4s. It works well for what it is, and has a considerable about of battery life. "
8230,Smaller than the new iPhones and works like a dream. Have has it for many years and still going strong
8231,My very first iPhone but it was still a great phone for an older model. The only drawback of the 4 was the screen size.
8232,Good phone but wanting to upgrade to a iphone 6 soon. But still recommend if you can't afford 
8233,I love my iPhone! I've used other smartphones in the past and Apple ID the best I've tried. The 4S (like all Apple products) are very user friendly and I love how I can connect my phone to my iPad. 
8234,I really like it. Mines is yellow though. No my experience; Apple has never failed me. 
8235,"This is one of the excellent old goodies !!!!!!!!!!!! Apple is known as premium brand in smart phones and 4S is no exception. Retina Display,metallic steel body,small size and sleek design still makes Apple 4S as a better choice. I am using this phone during last 6 months and completely overwhelmed by it's quality,precision and user friendliness !!!!!!!"
8236,"We purchased an Apple iphone 4S this year as our house phone. I have missed my iPhone. My husband uses his android products, but always complains about it locking up. I love the itunes and ability to transfer from all of my apple products. "
8237,"I really enjoy this cellphone. I bought it used, and it works well. I didn't install the updates ( I know some people had trouble after installing those)."
8238,There's nothing I have to say bag about this phone. I'm using it right now and it's outlasted my previous Samsung by a Longshot 
8239,I love my Iphone! It is so user friendly. The batter holds for a long time and my phone has held up. Love the updates so even when you don't have the new phone you can get some of the new features. 
8240,I had this iPhone about 2 years ago and I loved it! I have always been an apple fan and so far this brand hasn't failed me.
8241,"I purchased my 4s and used it for 4 years and it is still in perfect working condition, which is almost unheard of"
8242,We love Apple products in my home!! We find they are easy to use generation through generation. 
8243,Unlocked phone couldn't be used with Verizon. I am going to switch carriers so I can use it. I've had good experience with Apple. I have had an Ipod 2nd generation touch  for 4 years  and have had no problems with it. Unfortunately I can't update the operating system and this means I can't download any new apps.
8244,This is a ok phone. Even though it is the old version it still works great. Picture quality is ok. 
8245,"One of the most reliable phones Apple has ever made! While i have upgraded to a 5, this will always be one of the best phones ive ever owner, and one of the ones that lasted the longest."
8246,I absolutely love this apple iPhone and It works so good and lasts a long time..mostly i love the camera It takes amazing photos..
8247,"I know my phone is outdated, my kids are kind enough to remind me lol.  This phone has been great, no issues as long as I follow the software updates.  Only thing I wish I had more of would be storage, such a pain when you go to take a picture and you have no  storage and have to delete photos."
8248,Hate iPhone would never buy one again. Samsung is just as better and works the same way if not better. 
8249,Old faithful... this phone made it through a bunch of falls and even a bit of water. love apple would never get a different type of phone except an upgrade apple
8250,"Good phone! Lags at times, and can do some weird things, but still decent! Wish that they were more durable (same goes for all iPhones) and that they could withstand colder temperatures (it gets to -40 in Canada, where I live, and my phone dies constantly during the 4 month cold period)"
8251,Love this phone. Finally joined the apple product trend and I see why people love these phones so much. Works amazing simple to use has a ton of great features. Never have had a phone I have loved more.
8252,Received my first with this product and I couldn't be happier. It has a ton of storage and easy to navigate and use. Phone looks amazing and is a great product.
8253,"The iPhone is the best phone by far. It's fast, has a nice camera, nice big display, and great operating system. It also has widgets that attract all ages! Team iPhone! The 4's are slower since they are older."
8254,I had this phone for almost two years and had issues from day one. Decent camera but very slow system and tiny size. I also didn't like the glass backing as I had to replace many times even with a case... But that's what you get with iPhone but I will still give it a 1 star
8255,"I was so excited when I first used this iphone. It was small and compact. Light weight. , now it is a past generation and isn't as great as the newer models"
8256,"I love my phone and I am so happy I made the switch from android. There are so many apps available to me that were not on my other phones. I have only two small issues, my battery dies quickly and I had to adjust my notifications just to get it to last the work day. Also, its a a bit small. "
8257,"This is one of the worst phones I have ever had. I barely dropped it on the ground with a case on it, and the screen went out. It froze constantly, and didn't have a good camera at all. Just no."
8258,Love this phone. Very durable and well thought out all together. Easy to fit into my pocket unlike other brands that are trying to make it big like apple. I love the color as its pretty much flawless. This phone is simple and easy to use with a lot of space.
8259,"It's a good phone, a little pricey for what it does.
It was a little hard to figure out. Instructions were not clear as
they could have made it a little simpler."
8260,I had a Samsung Galaxy and wanted to switch back to an apple product so once the bigger iPhone came out I switched as soon as I can. I like the Iphone 6s for the camera and bigger screen. It is a simple phone and very user friendly. I do have issues with the phone freezing on me from time to time which I never had before.
8261,"Apple has been so bad with battery life and this product is one of those that doesn't really last long. Speakers are the best but with long usage and full volume, it is definitely not gonna last."
8262,"Phone works very well.  Could have stronger towers at times, but overall, very good.  Buy the protective case as cracking is easy when dropped.
"
8263,"It was good technology when it was new but with the 5 & 6 that have come out recently, it's a bit outdated."
8264,Its great. Connects to the internet very fast and the battary lasts good. Lots of storage is also great
8265,Ive had this phone for about 3 years and its ok works good minus when you play games it always kicks me off
8266,"Its a great phone but unfortunlty it stops working and boots me off sometimes
ill be in an app and just boosts"
8267,"Long battery life, never had any issues with the software updates like some did "
8268,Like Apple iPhone no virussen and i s so easy to be play with love the white one  
8269,"I love my iPhone 4s before getting the iPhone 6 work great for me, closer to the end the new updates weren't working so well though "
8270,A decent phone. Battery takes a while to charge but it is still solid overall! Life time of the battery is a little short
8271,I bought this phone awhile back and it was so small i forgot how small it look like but it was so cute at the same time i wanted to try out if i would like iphones in the end i really love it i upgrade to an iphone 5s now.
8272,"Even though this phone is getting out of date, I still love it! I love apple products because they are very durable and seemingly last forever. Now that is it getting older, I have had a few problems with it, but nothing that I couldn't fix. When I upgrade, I will still be sticking with Apple."
8273,Love this phone. Wanted a newer version but I always go back to my 4s. Very durable at least to me more than the others. 
8274,"I have this phone for 3 years, it is a great brand and I love my phone. I always take good pictures.Definitely If I change my Iphone will be for another Iphone :)"
8275,The 4S ran out of steam pretty close to the time it was purchased. There were a lot of updates after I bought it that I didn't feel like the phone could keep up. 
8276,It's a small phone in size and capacity. But if you are looking to move into a smartphone or need one for the kiddos to play with this is an excellent choice.
8277,Is small and handy it is one of the originals i like it very much its not like the huge nice gold ones although these you can easily fit in your bra or something
8278,"This is a great phone , mine lasted a good few years considering the abuse I gave it, due to me being extremely clumsy and accident prone. It has lived through being dropped down a flight of stairs , in the bath of water and dropped on the pavement.This is a great simple operated phone great for people who aren't great with technology or a young teenager's  first phone."
8279,"Works great so far...it has glass screen, so you need to be careful not dropping on the floor."
8280,The best smartphone to this day! Cannot be damaged easily. I have recommended this to everyone I know and have even opted to help them order this. It is worth the money.
8281,"The storage space is too small, the screen is too small, the phone is too heavy and my apps run too slow. "
8282,Easy to use. Compatible with other Apple devices. Reasonable size to fit in pockets. easy to share music and other media between devices.
8283,"To be honest, out of all the iphone: I really like 4s because of its size. Not too big and wide. Just at a perfect size."
8284,I recently upgraded to the 6s with AT&T. Before I had this phone. I had it for many years through Sprint. The phone was amazing even with updated software on an old phone. It was just time for an upgrade. If you can't afford a newer model of the iPhone do not hesitate to get an older one. You will still enjoy it. 
8285,Bought this phone from a friend. Not pleased at all. I'm definitely going back to Droid after this one.
8286,Very good phone personally was just looking for an update due to how outdated this is
8287,"Absolutely terrible. With all of the recent changes in the iPhone line, the 4s has become akin to a paperweight. There is no storage. You cannot update it, because if you do, you won't be able to even store a picture. If you can help it, skip this phone."
8288,Apple is my favorite smartphone brand. I believe that it has great quality and many options. It reminds when it needs to be updated. 
8289,I only purchase iPhones because they are always the superior phone choice!!
8290,All good things with iPhones ! I drop mine a lot get them wet on occasion and they last a long time
8291,"I enjoy iphones , with the iPhone 4s definitely is a lot heavier and smaller to the newest generations , bu is quite sturdy doesn't lack , doesn't default , served me right !"
8292,"Go buy one direction's new album on itunes and if you're reading this, it's too late fam."
8293,I've used this phone for 2 years and there are no problems with it! It has every thing I need. 
8294,"Great phone, just great everything! Although, it tends to overheat sometimes! "
8295,I got this phone and I love it I really is worth the money I would love to get the 6s in gold but have not got the money too 
8296,I started with the 4 and fell in love. Apple products are very easy to use and learn. I fingered out all the fun technology fast!
8297,"I love my iPhone, it is easy to use and the features are easy to use. The camera takes crisp clear photos, has a great map/navigator app that will never get you lost. 
 This phone has so many nice features such as an alarm clock, flashlight, compass, and I could go on forever about its easy to use apps. It holds a charge better than any phone I have had.  
We will stay with Verizon, we love the nationwide coverage and it is easy to get the plan you need with Verizon's helpful, knowledgeable staff. 
If you are looking for a great combination get an iPhone with Verizon."
8298,"Uno de los mejores avances de la historia. Son sumamente livianos, modernos y lujosos. "
8299,Clean sleek photos without blur. Great for customizing photos for social media and ease of use for video conversations
8300,Too old to keep up with. Everything switched to 4G and this doesn't load things as quick as a 5s or newer. 
8301,I still have the same phone because i need a new one. Has multiple problems 
8302,Absolutely love this phone I have had it for a while it is the best phone I have ever owned
8303,"Still using it. Great phone, compact and light. Perfect for traveling. I love how it fits everywhere. "
8304,My first iPhone! I've been with Apple every since. #TEAMIPHONE all day over here. I still know people that own this device and Apple's onto the 6s.
8305,Only phone I've never wanted to swap to a new one. I love the iPhone 4s. Very dependable. 5****s
8306,"I got this phone almost a year ago, it still works very well today. I got it for a great price and I'm just in love with Apple products in general."
8307,Made the switch to an iPhone from a Blackberry and it was SO worth it! I don't know how people can function with Blackberrys anymore... 
8308,"The Battery last a long time throughout the day, it is not to big of a phone and can store a lot of data "
8309,"I am a lover of all apple products, so of corse I own the apples 4S. It works just as well as any other apple phone, although in my opinion I would prefer to get the 64G due to the constant updates that can waste most of your GB."
8310,I had this phone for about 2 years. I liked it and it worked good until they came out with the newer phones and stopped making the updates. 
8311,This phone was virtually indestructible compared to the newer versions of the iPhone. Harder to crack the screen although I did crack a few of these. Overall a great size but a bit heavy. Started slowing down so had to upgrade to the iPhone 6. 
8312,Love and hate relationship with the iPhones. at times I really love my iPhone and other times I'd like to chunk it across the room. I hate how it comes preloaded with apps you never even use and it runs up your storage room. 
8313,"Lasts a long time. Great wear. Only negative is once you update your phone, the phone slows and lags in opening apps, and will unexpectedly quit apps as well. "
8314,"I had the 4s forever. I switched back to an android and quickly realized I made a mistake. Luckily, I lost that phone in the snow (I really did lose it) and had to get a new phone! I got the 6. So happy to be an IPhone user again!"
8315,"As you still , the new versions of iPhones are still out and i am still using my iPhone 4s. This product really does last long, it great since my laptop and iPad are apple so everything is connected to my phone. Love this phone!"
8316,"I have my phone since 4 years ago, And is the best best smarthphone. I love my iPhone. Thanks"
8317,I was always a fan of android and told myself I would never get in iPhone. I was convinced to get an iPhone and I absolutely love it!!!
8318,"Will always be an android girl at heart. BUT, the iPhone surprised me with its durability-- I dropped it SEVERAL times (uncased, to boot) and not a crack to be seen! Not laggy, has all the normal smartphone features. Love the camera. A bit difficult to integrate if you have mainly android or PC based technology (laptop etc) and some of the iCloud features are kind of scary. Siri sucks. "
8319,I enjoy the different apps you can download for free. The camera is horrible and it updates so much then my speakers don't work for days afterwards. I don't know what one has to do with the other and even my service provider can't help me. I definitely am thinking of getting a Samsung next. 
8320,Lasts for a vary long day had it for about 4 years still works great hold charge well and even though I have droped it a few times still works like before 
8321,Loved this phone and just upgraded to the 6s plus with 128g. Apple is easy to use and has lots of great apps and features that come wiTh it. I always come back to iPhone and have owned a few androids in the past. iPhone always has a way of pulling me back in!
8322,I recently bought the IPhone 4s. for my son an we absolutely  love it we have had no issues whatsoever. 
8323,It wasn't the greatest but worked for me for the time being that I needed a phone.. it was definitely a great phone when it first came out but there are many many other options that are better. Camara quality is not very good. 
8324,Enjoy it. Easy to use. Lots you can do with it. I love the calendar. I put things on it and set the alerts so I won't forget stuff. 
8325,I loved this phone. It lasted me 3 years. It began to get slower and I wasn't able to do to much else. It ran out of GB very quickly as I take lots of photos. All in all great phone. 
8326,Great phone! 16gb is not a lot of space tho! Couldn't have very many app or music on it 
8327,"All iPhones are pretty great in my opinion, what can you not do on them?  The 4s is definitely one of my favorites because of its ideal size and sophisticated appearance. The only thing I would say is that I have had trouble in the past with the back and front of the phone cracking pretty easily, but that may be me being clumsy! Also the camera quality seems to slightly lacked after a while of having the phone and memory seems to fill pretty quickly.. But all in all I wouldn't change my iPhone 4s for anything (wouldn't mind a 6s but beggars can't be choosers!) "
8328,My first iPhone and it made those long doctors office waits bearable. So easy to use and loved having a quality camera with me
8329,It works good but can a few cons I prefer if you're looking for a iphone get the iphone 6 or iphone 6s because my mon loves hers!
8330,Really good features and is always useful for day to day usage. I love the photo quality too 
8331,In general I like this brand Apple my husband and I had most of our electronics from this brand 
8332,"5 because in 2012 it was the new big thing, it does its job! Can't complain however the camera quality compared to my 6s makes all the difference BUT VERY durable "
8333,"I love this phone because it is easy to use, hold, take pictures with, and there is enough space on it to download all your favorite apps."
8334,"This is my phone. I've had this almost 3 years. Just replaced the battery a few days ago and bought an Otterbox case for it.  Going to  keep it awhile longer because my plan is too good to give up. The phone is mine and has been for quite awhile. It gets slow at times but it still does a great job. I bought an unlocked phone a BLU Studio 6.0 HD and I came back to my phone 4s for reliability. It works well it's my iPad too so I still love it.  Mine is outdated but I recommend the iPhone to anyone just starting out. Everything is common sense in this, it isn't hard to figure out."
8335,I stand behind Apple products can than again I do know how to take care of my stuff & if you do the product is outstanding. I I've upgraded through the iPhones and I've had no problem 👌🏼
8336,Great phone. Just be careful not to use the iOS updates as they are no longer compatible and may ruin your phone 
8337,I loved having a white phone. It was nice being able to tell our phones apart without a case
8338,Love al the Apple products. They are always easy to use and the very latest in technology 
8339,"Was a good phone in the beginning, but over time the battery became almost non existent. "
8340,"Though outdated, this iPhone is very useful. Better than most phone, takes good photos, not a good selfie camera but that's okay. "
8341,Great phone for a first time iPhone owner. It would only be better if the camera has a higher resolution.
8342,"I've had this phone for almost four years and it has been holding up really well. I have a case on it that helps protect it. I've dropped it multiple times and it still works. The only problem I've ever had is that it runs out of storage (mainly because of my pictures). Whenever I decide to upgrade, I would try to get the 32 GB instead of 16. "
8343,"Great earlier generation Iphone using Siri. 16gb of memory is not a great amount for apps, so I would suggest higher."
8344,"I've always loved apple products and! But the 4S was disappointing because I had to deal with a screen that cracked too easily and now that I have the 6, I can't even compare. The 6 's screen size is so much better!"
8345,"I upgraded to 5c, but I loved everything about the 4s. It's like a computer, but better!!"
8346,"My dad sent me his used iPhone 4s for my birthday last year and I use it to play music since it has more gig than my phone does. However, the battery doesn't last long at all but I guess what can you expect receiving a used phone as a gift? I'm sure it worked great when it was new."
8347,It was great for what I needed it for. I would actually still have this phone if I hadn't broken it. 
8348,"I had this phone for almost 3 years and I loved it to death! I only upgraded because I had to! For me this phone was steel, no matter how much I dropped it there was no damage. It always worked well for me! It was the first iPhone I ever had. "
8349,Extremely slow and not a lot  of storage. Many apps won't download because the four won't update to the most recent software. So glad u got rid of this phone and updated to the 5c
8350,Loved this phone as one of apples first iPhone products. Defiantly an awesome beginner phone. But be careful not to use up all your memory space. 
8351,"Love apple products, but the 4s has an issue with the wifi chip that greys the wifi out every couple of weeks!"
8352,"A wonderful phone, if you take care of it, it'll take care of you. I loved my 4S and used it up until it couldn't take any more, and my battery started to read incorrectly and not hold a charge. I replaced it with a 5S. Rest in peace, my sweet 4S prince(ss)."
8353,I love my iPhone. One thing I love the most is the camera. Also with every update I have done the phone gets better and better
8354,"Better than the 4c but...Easily broken, no expandable memory, not at all user friendly. Not my first choice in phones. Id rather spend the extra money and get an iphone 5s"
8355,"I highly recommend the iPhone I love mine don't know what I'd do without it so great full for it
 "
8356,Totally satisfied with my Iphone 6. This is my second Iphone and I have had great service with it. One of the best on the market. Verizon Wireless is great to deal with also. We are satisfied with their service and hope to continue to stay with them for the long haul.
8357,I've had this phone for a few months its nice and very easy to operate only thing is its very easy to break and most protection cases are bulky 
8358,"Ahhhh! I need more storage. At the time, I wanted the 6+ and, of course, Verizon did not have it. Because I needed a phone for my business this was a last resort. I will always be an Apply fan but I look forward to my 64GB 6+ very soon. "
8359,"Iphone4s what can I say?! You were a beast! Couldn't kill it if I tried :) and it still lives today, my low maintenance boyfriend who only texts and makes phone calls, loves it! The last strong and sturdy iPhone!"
8360,"This was actually my very first smartphone and it is what I'm using currently. I plan to upgrade soon but I've had this phone for years and have never had any problems with it except when I had an issue with a software update which Apple fixed for me. It's a great starter smartphone, runs well, and has more than enough storage space "
8361,"I will only ever use apple! Sure they have their flaws sometimes but what company doesn't? I personally thought that the iPhone 4s was a perfect size for phones just needed a better quality camera, it's a great phone though. All of apples stuff is great, thank you Steve Jobs."
8362,Have this as a work phone and if the company hadn't given it to me and paid the bill I would have went back to android 
8363,"Loved this phone. The screen is small compared to the newer models but it's still a great phone. Camera is good, light and easy to use"
8364,"I used this phone prior to my iPhone 5s. This phone operates like much of the other Apple Products. I find them user friendly and reliable. The screen tends to break easily, so I would suggest getting an Otterbox or other protective case if you purchase this phone. "
8365,I h s 've the 5s so I can't really speak for the 4. But I'm quite impressed with my iPhone 5 s. Great service and features
8366,I like my phone but I have notice that since its an old iphone I am not able to get all the apps that i want and will have to get a newer one soon
8367,"It doesn't get much easier than an iPhone!  If you're looking for something easy to use and hard to screw up, choose this!"
8368,"I love my phone,, its the easiest phone I've ever used,, I don't go anywhere without it and wouldn't trade I for anything !! It takes amazing pictures and has a great sound quality !!!"
8369,Phone holds apps good and gets really good call and texts. it doesn't hold much battery though. I love the feel of it with it being small also. and the speed is really good in select providers. 
8370,This phone works really well. Unlike the iPhone 4 it does support iOS 9.2 which you need to purchase most apps. This is a good quality phone which anyone can easily use.
8371,This is great the only problem would be how it sometimes slows down. Other than that its Awsome
8372,"Es un smartphone de primera, es exclusivo, sus aplicaciones funcionan rápido, es recommendable usar los accesorios originales de apple para que no dañe el equipo, lo único que no me gusta es que es muy delicado si se moja en agua por accidente, de todas las marcas del mercado, éste es el que no se recupera de una mojada en agua y es algo complicado recuperar la información del mismo si no lo sustituyes por otro iphone, pierdes toda la información, supongo que es un método para tener la exclusividad y obligarte a seguir con la marca, igual en lineas generales es un buen smartphone"
8373,"When it had just came out it was awesome. Like any phone it gets played out. By the time the 5s came out I felt it was too slow , and I was having too many complications. iPhones to me can't be older than two years or the speed or the perks play out. "
8374,So so  lasted about a year and a half. Hard to determine what makes the glitches occur. Updates never seamed to help
8375,"A very good cell phone, is me cai and not miss anything is to wet and continues to operate the brand ois is a highly recommended brand by my"
8376,I give Apple 4 stars because the phone is well built and easy to use.  I decided to switch over to Android because I felt Apple kept putting out the same phone over and over without much change. While Apple isn't a bad product I just don't find them to be very inovative after using them for 5 years.
8377,It's not the best I had it for a while befor di I updated but it's alright . I'm currently have the phone and don't j ow what to do with it since it's so out dated 
8378,We have had our phones for 5 years and love them.  I get all the apps I need plus the conveniences of having a smartphone.  
8379,"Great to use, easy, and fast to get around, everything that needs to be adjusted is on one app, the settings."
8380,Its an older generation but its still an awesome phone and one the harder models. The newer ones break easily. 
8381,"Loved my phone so much (now I have the 6). Although I only had 16GB I had over 10,000 pictures and a few apps. Love the interface of Apple great product. "
8382,I am enjoying the product but i have had problems and issues with it  like card errors .  but  after having phone replaced id hafta say  things are looking up. 
8383,I have this phone and it is still kicking. Although I just had the screen (front and back) replaced and now it doesn't work quite right
8384,I really like my iPhone.  It does just about everything I need it to do.  My one complaint is that the gps doesn't seem to be accurate. I'm a runner and when using a running app the gps tracking can be more than 1/2 mile off compared to my Garmin watch and actual official race measurements. 
8385,"Back when I had one, it served me well. It took nice pictures and it was quick and easy to use. "
8386,I love my Iphone. So easy to use compared to my last smartphone (samsung Ace2) only downfall is the camera could be better as the pic are poor quality.
8387,Nice small phone not to big unlike the iPhone 6 cheap but still runs great.  Need to start making them this size again
8388,"My phone has unfortunately broke,but i love iphones. They are great,and i need to get the 6s. I heard they were amazing "
8389,Apple will always be the best when it comes to smart phones. great functionality the only problem was the battery life it only lasted for about four or five hours. other than that was fine. 
8390,It was decent. I'd prefer to break away from the Apple cult but I have all Apple products so it's a bit challenging.
8391,My fiancé just bought me the iPhone 4s and I love it so much. I'm such a lucky lady. I loved all the colors they had available. I chose gold to match my ring. 
8392,I absolutely loved this phone. But my spouse had bought us new lg nexus' and I switched on one hand Apple is so protective and the other cell phone companies are not I love my iPhone more than any other phone I have used!
8393,"This phone lasted me almost three years! It is pretty easy to crack since it has a glass-covered back, but overall it is a quality phone."
8394,"I had a lot of problems with this cellphone, it would turn off by itself and it wouldn't turn on and i research and found out iphone 4s had some  glitches."
8395,"I went through hell with this phone, falls etc., it didn't cracked or nothing. Great phone!"
8396,My mom has this which automatically means I do half the usage. I think it works well for her as her first smartphone. She has Siri and it cracks her up. Siri makes things a lot easier especially since my mom wears glasses and sometimes doesn't know how to navigate the phone so she will just ask Siri and Siri always delivers. I think it's a great phone even if it's a bit old. Still works perfect. 
8397,"Si  y No.
Realmente no soy fan de esta marca, siempre he preferido mas otro tipo de sistema, para mi aunque paso horas en la computadora y aparatos es dificil, supongo que te acostumbras, pero aun asi, no es lo mio."
8398,"I love almost everything about this phone. Suri and I do not get along so well but I just stopped asking. I really like the ease of use, and the apps are very helpful."
8399,"I got this phone when it was first released. I used it for 4 years with no issues. Great call quality and a long battery life. The only thing I didn't like about this phone was the poor quality front facing camera. The photos always looked fuzzy. The phone itself performed well until the recent updates (2015) It has begun to act laggy/slow and many apps wouldn't run correctly on it. This is to be expected with newer more demanding operating systems on older phone builds. Because of this, I recently decided to get a newer phone. "
8400,I love Apple iPhones.  They are easy to navigate.  There isn't a lot of guesswork involved with learning how to use the device so it's perfect for even a small child.
8401,"Very smart. It was like using a mini computer, typing on a keyboard that is on the screen.
"
8402,"I like how light it is and slim. I ran out of storage pretty fast though mainly taking pictures. Also my friends Samsung's phone has a much nicer camera, picture quality doesn't compare. :("
8403,"Muy lindo, y actrastivo, ojala viniera en alguno de los paquetes, jeje dios asnos el milagrito jejeje, estos telefonos son d everdad solo para divas, hay algunos que dicen que no sirve para nada pero yo digo que es lo mejor que a echo el hombre"
8404,I currently  have  this phone  and while it's  great  it's  annoying how they  changed the  charger  so  this  phone has a less  common  charger  now  because  almost  everyone has  the  lightning  charger  not  the  30 pin charger 
8405,"I think out of all iphones, this one has to be the best because it a perfect size and it has a nice deign to it. I don't know why apple keeps making iphones bigger, they should make a phone that's waterproof so that I could take underwater "
8406,"I've had this for a while now, and it's the type of product that is so amazing, once you own it, you can't imagine life without it."
8407,This is outdated. The phone glitches and runs slow because it cannot keep up with the new software. Best off getting a 5 or 6!
8408,"Hoensly idc what anyone says. This was my favorite phone. I liked the design and the shape. It was so cute. Unfortunately, the processor in this phone wasn't built for all of the updates which causes the phone to lag."
8409,"I have used my iPhone 4s for almost three years and it has been a great phone. It kept its battery life, took great pictures, and had plenty of storage space. I recently upgrade to the iPhone 6 and was able to sell my 4s on eBay for a little over $100. It is great that it has retained its value over the past 3 years!"
8410,"I love the iphone 4s, best phone ever in my opinion, very reliable and works great and fast! two thumbs up"
8411,"Horrible battery life, but I've had it for over 2 years and it is still working properly for the most part."
8412,Great phone! I absolutely loved mine but I have loved every product Apple has so far! The screens and complete phone is all worth every penny!
8413,I had A lot of issues with my iPhone 4s. More issues than with any other model of iPhone I have ever purchased. I had to have it replaced 3 times. It was a bugger.
8414,The 4S is so outdated it is ridiculous. Every one I have come across recently have had problems with upgrading to the newer is and battery life is a joke.
8415,"This phone is awesome, especially if you can't afford a lot because with a contract it's free now yay!!! It's not too different from newer models it just looks different"
8416,"Great, user-friendly phone.  I like being able to sync easily with my Macbook.  This phone is durable and has good battery life.  My only complaint is that the battery life seems to decrease over time."
8417,"I've had my iPhone 4s for almost 2 years now and it's still in good shape and in good working order. The screen cracked pretty badly though, but I'm getting it fixed soon so it's all good. Never had to bring it in for repairs other than that. Only had to get a replacement charger a few months ago too. I know this phone obviously isn't the newest iPhone, but it has emojis and iMessage and Siri and etc. And my plan is good, so it's good for me. When I'm able to upgrade though, I will most likely get an iPhone 5s or iPhone 6 though. But for now this is my baby :)"
8418,It's like a futuristic laptop. Most amazing phone other than the newest iPhone. This one is smaller than the iPhone 5 though! Which I think is better!
8419,"My husband bought me an iPhone 4S last year for my birthday. Having previously owned an iPhone 3, I was excited to get my hands on the latest generation of my phone. So far, it hasn't disappointed. I can do just about anything on my new phone. My favorite thing about the iPhone 4S has to be Siri. Being a business owner, i am constantly using her to set alarms, text for me, and even look up things online. While this software has a long way to go, I am curious to see how Siri will evolve over time! 

The only thing I don't like about my phone is that it seems to have a shorter battery life compared to my old phone. While this isn't a huge deal, it can be a bit of a drag if you are constantly checking your email or listening to MP3s. "
8420,"Prior to owning my iPhone I was never content with ANY smartphone I owned (this includes: a Motorolla Moto Q, 2 HTC android phones, and a Blackberry.) I have had my iPhone for over a year and I still love it.  Many times I have said, I will never own another brand of phone.  It's great quality, user friendly, and not too large."
8421,"I've had IPhones for the past 4 years and I loved every one. The layout is nice and simple. Sooooooany apps, useful and not so useful:) I tried switching to a Backberry and a HTC to try something different and hated them. I constantly use it for work and really makeshift life easier. A mini computer in your pocket.  I'm a loyal Apple Iphone user for life!"
8422,"I used to be a nokia person for several years. Then I moved on to blackberry, I loved the qwerty pad and the simple user interface. But then late in 2011 I got an iphone and I couldn't be happier. I wouldn't go back to nokia and blackberry. Iphone all the way! "
8423,I love my iphone 4s! i love apple products! i never wanna trade my iphone is because it literally does everything! i will continue to be with apple for as long as there are iphones!
8424,"I love my 4S. It hasn't failed me yet. It is a drastic improvement from my old 3G. It's faster and can run more apps (my 3G was basically obsolete when I made the switch). My biggest disappointment was that even though I purchased the 16 gig version, it really only holds 13 gigs. Kind of a bummer since these phones aren't cheap!"
8425,I Have Recently Switched From HTC To Apple And I Love It!.. My One Year Old Even Knows How To Play My Music It Is A Very Smart Phone!....
8426,"I have had an iPhone, an Android, and a Windows Phone over the past year and a half. The iPhone is absolutely fantastic in that it is so easy to just pick up and use. However, I feel that once you learn to use it, it isn't as good as an Android or Windows Phone. That certainly does not stop it from being the best smart phone to buy for someone who needs an easy phone to learn to use - there's a reason kids constantly want to play with them!

The variety of apps is also a huge plus as compared to Windows Phone in particular. Android is catching up!"
8427,"I got an iphone after having had a HTC for 2 years. Texting is far superior on the HTC, it irritates me EVERY time I need to switch screens to use a number or punctuation mark as they are available on one screen on the HTC. Big waste of time switching between screens! Also, I miss my back button!
"
8428,"I'm on my 27th phone, and this has been the most reliable! I love everything about it! I wouldn't even give it up for the new iPhone 5, which i was offered for free. Great phone, and apple always seems to work great with my requests and if the phone is not working they always know how to help!"
8429,I love this phone more than anything! It is so easy to learn to navigate. I haven't upgraded yet cuz I'm still in love! 
8430,"I upgraded from the iphone 3 and must say that this phone was a big improvement. Apps run a lot faster and I can do so much with this phone from making calls, emails, taking pictures and so much more. "
8431,"This phone has literally changed my life. Sad to say, but I am 100% dependent on this phone. I Love how much this phone can do! Anything I can think of that I need help with, this phone can do. THe contacts, calendar and basic phone neccessities are so basic, yet so advanced. Apple has a fantastic way of making things so simple to use, yet so dynamic at the same time. The screen is beautiful! My phone acts as my camera, calendar, address book, email, iPod, and so much more! I even use it as my credit card! 

By far the #1 phone in the world. "
8432,"I bought my iPhone 4S last year after using Blackberry for years, and I couldn't be happier. The phone is much easier to use than I expected, and the quantity of apps available by far exceeds Android and Blackberry! Of course, there are situations where your iPhone may short - which happened to mine, but it was still under the warranty and they replaced it for free! "
8433,Switched from a BlackBerry to the iPhone 4S about 2 years ago and have never looked back.  I would recommend an iPhone to anyone and everyone!  
8434,"I would be lost without my phone.  Really!  It is my alarm clock, my cookbook, my calendar and of course, it keeps me updated with friends and family.  The iphone is easy to use, durable, and has a great camera on it."
8435,"I got my iPhone just over 1 year ago. I got the 16gb black 4s.  The 16 gb is more than enough for me, and I have over 300 pictures, 50 apps, and over 450 songs.  I didn't think I would need most of the apps, but after a year, it has become my lifeline.  I use the calendar every day for work and school projects. I can check facebook and my other social networks. I let my little sister play games on it when we're in the car. I have a square card reader for my personal business, so it is my register at check out. I use the music app whenever I work out.  The camera app at the lock screen is perfect for catching pictures at the perfect moment. There are a ton of cases and chargers available just about anywhere in case you forget yours. The iMessage settings are so easy to manuever also. I've dropped my phone several times and have had no problems with anything breaking (I use a screen protector and phone case). 

I have absolutely no complaints about my iPhone 4s and have been influenced several friends decisions to get their first iPhones.  I LOVE my iPhone 4s more than some people... "
8436,Its really nice and has a good exterior. It has all the essentials. Overall its quite good.
8437,"I love my iphone 4s phone! Its everything to me. There are so many skins and cases you can pick for your phone. The camera quality isn't that bad, i like it. I LOVE THE PICTURE APPS THO to make your picture look creative and pretty. "
8438,"My iPhone is my partner in crime, it never leaves my side and is always there for me. I would not trade this phone for any other phone on the market. I love it."
8439,"This Phone (4s) is my life. 
I have games, apps, gps, phone/address book, Audio books, music, to do list, day to day items, etc. 

This phone is my lifeline. 
so many things in one. "
8440,I would be lost without my Iphone 4S. Siri is my BFF:)
8441,"I absolutely love this phone. I've had it for about three months now, and I adore it. It runs very fast, plays apps and videos smooth, and the best thing about it- IT STAYS CHARGED! I definitely recommend trying this phone if you haven't already."
8442,I love love love my iphone 4s! I constantly have it with me and use it 24/7. I've never had a problem with it and it is super easy to use! Although it's a little pricey without a plan but is definitely worth the switch!
8443,"My favorite smart phone by far. No lagging and I've had it for a little over a year now, which was always the problem I ran into with my old cell phones and I'm not even the sort to load it up on data and media and whatnot. The iPhone 4s is great because it comes in two neutral colors of black or white which is a clean slate for you to customize with numerous of cases to your little hearts desires. Having an iPhone was really helpful with syncing with my personal laptop and plugged in mac-based college campus.I'm a graphic designer so to be able to experience user interfaces from a first hand, every-day experience was really helpful. It definitely helped me improve the way I think."
8444,"I've had this phone about 8 months now and hasn't failed me, it's the perfect size & great camera quality, if you have a case and screen protecter it will be fine I've dropped mine several times yet it is in perfect working condition"
8445,I've tried many phones and my iPhone 4 is my favorite! The apps and the way it works is just way better and more appealing to me than the other phones. It's not like any one else's you'll find!
8446,"I currently own the 4s and when I bought it I was so excited for Siri. I was debating on whether I should just get the iPhone 4 or 4S. The iPhone 4 was much cheaper, but it didn't have siri and I was super excited to try it out. So, I just save a little longer and purchased the 4s. Now that I own it, I wish I had just purchased the 4. I merely bought the 4S for Siri and I have never actually used it. Yes, I played around with it the first few days, asking it dumb questions, but I have never had any real reason to use it. It's completely overrated. I should have just saved my money and stuck with the iPhone 4. iPhones are great though. I rarely have a problem with it freezing up or just refusing to work. If I ever have a problem, which is extremely rare, I just power it down and then turn it back on and it solves the problem."
8447,"I have the 4s, and it has many issues, but it is an overall good phone. I can't wait till Sep 20, to get the 5s."
8448,"The iPhone 4S was my all time favorite phone, wish I didn't upgrade to my iphone 5. Sleek design, smooth and simple operating system."
8449,"I just think that it's too easy to break if you're an on the go person as I am. But other than that, I love it! "
8450,"I used to love my iPhone.  After jailbreaking it, it was able to do everything I wanted. But then I switched to Android.  

My HTC One did everything I wanted to out of the box.  The screen was brighter, larger, and looked amazing in comparison to the iPhone.  The front facing speakers sounded great and the Beats headphones were even better.  I loved that I had a little flashing light to notify me about email and messages.  But the biggest thing was the camera.  The forward facing camera on the iPhone 4S is garbage.  I always looked orange and slightly blurry, whereas the HTC One takes sharp, quality photos from the front and back.  

Since switching, I've found that the only thing I miss is AirPlay, but Android phones will be able to do that in the very near future, so I'm not too worried about it."
8451,From switching to a blackberry bold to an iPhone 4S was one of the best decisions I've made in technology. There's more things to do around with the phone. The camera doesn't seem to be as clear as I thought it used to be but it's workable. 
8452,I think it's a great phone! It has everything I need! 
8453,I had the iPhone 4S and loved it. It got broke so I had to switch to an android and I hated it. The front camera  was horrible and blurry unlike my iPhone. I just loved the layout and apps better on my iPhone. Yes the screen may be smaller but the quality was way better! The graphics on games were great along with videos and it had pretty load speakers. And I'm one excited girl because I have that should be coming in any day now! Can't wait I'm excited!!!!!
8454,"The only downside I have with my iPhone is the lack of camera quality and also that the 8gb runs out very quickly. I find myself constantly deleting apps, pictures and always resetting my phone to add my storage. Other than those few things this phone is amazing"
8455,"I owned one and eventually the system is just too basic for me. everything requires a purchase , from ringtones, and  decent compatible apps for business, music, or convenient related apps. this is perfect for someone new to smart phones. can't even add my  mp3's to the phone without having to go through so many steps to convert and drag when attached to a computer. "
8456,My iPhone 4S was a great phone when I got it but now having it for 2 years now it's slowly slowing down and freezing up on me :( I so cannot wait for the iPhone 6 to come out I am soooooo ready!!
8457,I loved this phone. It had all the capabilities I needed in a smartphone until the microphone went bad. Then I replaced it with a 5
8458,Never gave me any problems!  Was one of the longer lasting phones I've had!  Would probably still be working if I had not chosen to upgrade!
8459,I was with my iPhone 4s a very long time (2 years!). Basically my whole life was on it! I eventually had to let it go because it was slowing down even after backing the whole thing up and the camera started to become foggy.
8460,I had this phone and at first it was awesome because it was my very first iphone but then it slowly but surely started to get different issues and the exterior buttons start not to work for me. I also felt that after a while many android phones were much more high tech and had more features 
8461,"I've had my phone for over two years and I haven't had any major problems. I did get water damage and surprisingly after a couple days it went back to working just fine. I do notice it slowing down now, and often closing out apps but I just associate that with the previous water damage. "
8462,"I bought the 4 on a prepaid plan in February and while I was ecstatic to get my first iPhone I wasn't able to afford a new one so I received mine pre owned. While I liked everything about the phone (layout, all touch, apps, iMessage, FaceTime) it just wasn't winning me completely over. Even with small hands it still hurt texting occasionally, my apps were constantly crashing on me, my touch screen messed up and my lock button was very hard to push. Overall it's an okay phone for someone not looking for anything fancy"
8463,These phones are amazing uou can do badically anything for it. Its like a miny computar.
8464,"I went from a metorla razor, not a big fan of apple phone program and it will force close programs I am on and that is annoying. I do enjoy the bigger selection of apps tho  "
8465,"I went through two of the 4s's before I upgraded to a 5s... I like the Iphone, but feel like they need to be a little more durable. I dropped my first 4s on a RUG and it broke the whole internal screen, even with a case on!. Every time I inadvertently drop my phone I hold my breath picking it up, hoping it still work. Other than that, I'm happy with my Iphone."
8466,This phone was my first experience with an Apple product. It was a good little phone for about 2 years and then it just started to take a dump and I went back to Android
8467,The iPhone 4s introduced the world to Siri. It has an amazing screen and an amazing camera. It has a fast processor which is good for games. You have plenty of choices for cases too!
8468,I love all apple product  I am currently using an apple iPhone XR  but have used a number of previous models  each one better than the previous
8469,I loved the size of this phone  it was my favorite I phone . This one fit in all of my purses and you could use any charger
8470,"Honestly, I loveeeeed this phone! I remember when they first came out and I was so excited to have one. I mean, back then you weren’t cool unless you had one LMBO only thing about them was the battery life sucked"
8471,This was a great introduction to Apple. It was my first iPhone and I liked it and used all the features. It is small compared to todays phones.
8472,"Since it was my first Apple Product, I was excited and surprised with its unique look. The interface was user friendly."
8473,"Este fue mi primer iPhone y lo ameeeee demasiado. Es un excelente teléfono, que soporto muchísimo y me duró bastante! Sin duda fue un hit en su momento"
8474,"I really love apple for its safety, and also for its quality, it is a brand that I would love to use again, I like it very much."
8475,This was my first apple cell phone that I used and I said there was no looking back after using an apple phone. From iPhone 4s I have come a long way to using apple iPhone X now. I know it’s time for me to change phones but we’ll it works so well don’t feel like changing it. Also I have never used an android phone after switching to apple phones from last so many years.
8476,This was my 1st iPhone! I got this when it 1st came out! It was a good phone when it came out. It was so cool and new . Things I haven’t seen in a phone before. And I have upgraded every two years after that with the newest and latest iPhones!
8477,"I loved this phone beyond the telling of it. 
It was literally pried from my hands cold and dead. I mean I am clearly still alive and well, but I kept that phone and refused to give it up far beyond planed obsolescence came for it. The phone company had to call me to tell me it was no longer going to be supported on x date and I HAD to get another. Sigh. They killed my 4. I loved it. It was such a fantastic little phone. That I put through ALL the paces!"
8478,The very first iPhone i ever bought. It was the greatest thing. I was going to buy a blackberry and an iPod at the time and thought why not get the iPhone that does both? Best decision ever made and I’ve been with Apple ever since.
8479,I bought this by my own money which I have saved for several months. I was proud and confident with this phone even it’s not latest phone at that time.
8480,"I hate this phone so much. Was so dang small, glitched, storage really sucked, I could go on and on. And it didn’t last very long either!"
8481,Es un buen producto pero ya con los cambios que ha tenido el mundo ya podemos ver por ejemplo los iphone 12 o 11 este articulo es él papá de los iphone su camara su velocidad es muy diferente a lo que tenemos hoy en dia pero sigue siendo una maquina muy buena
8482,This was a good phone for my first iPhone. It lasted about two years before starting to glitch. The size was perfect for one hand abs was super user friendly.
8483,"Was a great phone at the time, best in its class, but time has flown and nowadays this phone may not even work. It is really slow compared to todays phones. But a nostalgic click for sure!"
8484,"This phone was insanely slow. Would probably not use again. Of course, it was one of the first iPhones."
8485,"The 4s was my very first iPhone, and I still remember how much I loved this phone. Siri was brand new and I used her settings for just about every task. The phone was never slow until the very tail end of my 2 year lease. I’ll always have a special spot in my heart for this phone!"
8486,Great phone. I never have a problem when using an apple iPhone. 10/10 recommended! I’m always looking for the newest tech!
8487,"This iPhone is actually my favorite style of iPhone visually. I loved the glass detail. These days, however, this phone is extremely outdated. If faced with the option of buying this phone or a newer one, I would definitely recommend purchasing a newer style which will have faster processing speeds￼."
8488,"one of the best phone i have ever owned, easy setup, good camera and fairly priced and solid, the only drawback was the cross platform problems between IOS and android. Would i buy a Iphone again ? YES but both iphone and samsung a too expencive for how clumsy i am"
8489,"Pointless phone slow, battery didn’t last long camera wasn’t good, processor was shocking to small of a phone wasn’t great at all"
8490,This was my first iPhone and it was ok. Compared to the others it was kind of slow. I had it for a long time so it does work well. It was reliable and was still working when I got another one. I think it did a great job.
8491,"è un prodotto eccellente,  di fascia alta , ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo e bellissimo design, lo consiglio a tutti"
8492,This was a great phone when I got it 10 years ago. Pretty sure it’s still kicking around in a drawer somewhere. I wouldn’t recommend it in 2022 and there is so many up-to-date options to choose from￼￼
8493,I loved my 4s! Siri was a game changer! One of my favorite phones! I will continue using apple products.
8494,"Light, smart, small! I loved it and still love it. The only thing bad is that after few years it starts to be slow and battery to be changed! I use it as second phone"
8495,I will always have an affinity for this phone because it was my first iPhone. It was everything I could have asked for and a major reason I continued to upgrade to different iPhones and still stick with them today.
8496,I love all things apple! Who doesn’t! It’s very convenient and it’s so much than just a look! I just hate the updates we constantly have to do but i learn something new about my devices everyday
8497,Era piccolissimo! Ma comunque era molto resistente. Un tasto per qualsiasi funzione.
8498,"I love apple products, this is the one that started it all for me. I kept it for as long as possible. I dropped it, it was fine. The battery life was amazing and when it came time to upgrade I knew I was going to continue with apple products"
8499,Works very well. I use this product a lot and it is easy to use and there is nothing really to improve because this product is very good and it is the best out of all of them I definitely recommend. 10/10.
8500,"It’s outdated now, but at the time it was the first phone with Siri, it was the perfect assistant. The other features were typical apple, but Siri was a super cool feature that was new at the time."
8501,My 1st iPhone. So small compared to today’s models. Who can’t forget the finger button.
8502,Loved this phone never had any issues still in perfect condition just doesn’t hold battery life now .
8503,"Apple iPhone 4S non funziona più whatsapp per il resto ottimo cellulare, mi sono trovata molto bene , molto resistente!"
8504,"tueno pues la valoración ahora ismo no puede ser muy alta aunque cuando lo compre para mi fue lo mejor que he tenido en mis manos de teléfonos respecto a lo que había en ese momento pero ahora mismo , le faltarían muchas opciones de las que hoy en dia hay en cualquiera delos telefonos de apple "
8505,"Was amazing when it came out, but my current devices doesn’t have the same size - The current isn’t as amazing"
8506,Great phone option and loved the small footprint that allowed it to fit easily in my pcokekt
8507,My old iPhone 4 worked fabulous for many years. I had to finally upgrade to a newer phone as the software was no longer compatible.
8508,"My very first apple product and it didn’t disappoint. Since this was a gift, every year I received an iPhone for our anniversary."
8509,It was great back in the day. I was an early iPhone adopted & have had every iteration of the model.
8510,I love this phone Long lasting battery the only thing is that the power button broke only after two weeks of use besides that it is still going definitely long lasting phone never dies￼
8511,It was a really good phone to have when it first came out. It wouldn't be a great option now since we're used to bigger screens. Also as soon as a newer model would come out the phone would stop working.
8512,iPhone 4S was the first iPhone I own and it was very good I like the speak into text feature the best really help me  writing Remember when I first got it I use it for my papers￼￼
8513,"what a time to be alive when this first released! it was my first smartphone and i loved it— it was easy to used with a clean design. and by the time i got mine, they were modifying the phones (jail breaking and changing out the glass for colored glass) i wanted to do that, but apple also had a warranty that would void if you did such things to your phone. so, i enjoyed the phone as is with a privacy screen until i eventually upgraded to the 5s and so on."
8514,"Sin duda para mi iPhone es una excelente.marca, excelentes productos compraría todos los productos de ser posible y necesario cosa que todos deben de estar de acuerdo absolutamente, me encantan!"
8515,Was a long time ago. But done the job at the time. Passed on to my daughter to use. Quite small now compared to newer ones
8516,"Oh how tiny this phone is compared to the newer models! Very affordable now but I’m not sure how effective it will be given the new iOS’ that have come out and might not be compatible. Small screen, drops easily, shatters easily as well."
8517,button would get worn out and get more and more pushed in as time went on. hardly any sound and the photo quality is not good at all. was one of apples first phones so i can’t judge too much but i don’t recommend
8518,Oh my gosh it’s great to tryouts I tried it it’s greates thing ever I tried you just give it try and enjoy I enjoyed I am sure you will too it’s really great
8519,Original OG phone. This thing handled so much! Honestly one of the strongest apple products I had. Way to small tho
8520,So small lol at the time was nice. I upgraded my iPhone and my daughters iPhone. iPhones are expensive
8521,My very first iPhone. I did like the compact size of the phone.  It had all functions needed and worked very well. It was durable and held up to drops dues to the square edges.  I did not need to replace the screen or did not have any issues with charging and battery life.  
8522,"This was my cell phone for 5 years.  The apple camera is something that has no comparison.  Its size is very practical.  We have to be honest, the problem with Apple is that then the equipment is discontinued.  However this is an excellent cell phone.  Period."
8523,this was my first apple phone and i loved it! was thicker than the newer ones now and way smaller but it was cute
8524,AMAZING phone! Just got it for a second phone for business and personal use from target and I realized its a great value buy. Highly recommend to everyone looking for something that's functional and still durable and sturdy. highly recommend!
8525,I like the size very much! I can easily hold it with one hand and put it in any pocket on my cloth. The speed is also very fast. It’s the best phone I had during that time and I think the advantage of 4s is way more than the other brand! Recommend!
8526,Now an vintage iPhone but great at its peak non the less. Would recommend a good quality case as the screen easily breaks when dropped.
8527,"this was my very first iphone. i miss it, it was such great tech for that moment in time! i still have photos saved from using this phone. its such nostalgia. love it! lol if it was still compatible to use today, i probably would."
8528,"It was an amazing phone. It helped me took cute photos. The body was also glass which makes it feel premium. I love the IOS it had which featured 3d looking app icons. Even though it is slow, especially at this time and age, it was an amazing phone when I first purchased it. Back them when I was using the phone, I didn't had a problem with it."
8529,It’s old now and way too small. Back in the day it was great. Didn’t need a case it was solid.
8530,I had this phone years ago & also had to re use it a few years back before I got a new one & it worked just fine. You can’t download any apps or anything like that without a new model of phone.
8531,"This was my first iPhone. As I remember it was pretty good. A bit small, so I upgraded for a 6s"
8532,"I had purchased an Apple iPhone 4S not long after they were released. It was my first iPhone but was not my first Apple product, that was an iPod shuffle in 2001 or so. I had long been wanting to use the iPhones so when I had an opportunity to get one in 2011/12 I did. It was such a good phone that I still have it to this day. The only problem with it is that I don't have a charging cable for it anymore and don't know where to buy one."
8533,"This is a good cheap iPhone for kids to start out on or parents if you like the price point which is really low oh, these are very reliable phones and can be used with child protection features, and definitely met my expectations for a kid's phone. I would recommend it to parents everywhere."
8534,This was my very first iPhone I still have it and it still works! Very sturdy build. I use it as an iPod now. It’s older generation tops the newer models I guess
8535,The phone was very cheap and broke multiple times. Apple has come a long way from these cash grab devices.
8536,"For its time, it was amazing and innovative given the addition of Siri. Siri has arguably fallen off since the release of this phone but initially was amazing. Was durable and got the job done."
8537,It’s made by apple so it works great every time. I still use it even though I have a new phone.
8538,I loved this little phone. It fit perfectly in my small hands which made it so easy to use. I did wish it had more gb on it when I had it. But it lasted me 7 years. Which is long for a phone.
8539,Decent for when these were on the market. Not it’s too small for me to handle. My mom has my old phone and it’s very small and battery isn’t the best.
8540,I love my apple phone. Applications open fast and it is comfortable to use. You can also choose your phone colour.
8541,"My first iPhone and I remember it so fondly, excellent camera, fast and noble.  I only changed my iphone 4s because it was so outdated but I loved it"
8542,Such a great phone as the size is a little smaller than the newer ones on the market so no issues with keeping it inside a pocket/small handbag! Great quality from Apple as expected
8543,This was actually my 1st iPhone. Hated how big the charger was after the iPhone 5 came out. Basically now comparable to an iPhone 5 but worst
8544,My first ever iPhone! Prior to this I had Blackberry bold and this was my first phone with no keypad/with a touchscreen! It was my first venture into iPhone and have never left since!
8545,"this product lasted forever!! like an actual brick, I dropped it a million times and it never cracked. my first iPhone ever"
8546,Was an excellent phone. I believe it was the first to feature Siri (may be wrong). Absolutely loved it but unfortunately lost it about a month after buying it. Reliable and innovative.
8547,"One of the best iPhones ever made! Way out of date now but a fantastic product, and a design that the iPhone 12 line was based on. Long time Apple user."
8548,A standard quality apple phone. Small in size and easy to use. I would say for me the screen was too small and the battery didn’t seem to last long at all. Price was okay. Wouldn’t recommend if you were looking for a phone for anything other than text/phone calls due to the size.
8549,My first iPhone and I really loved it.  The size was perfect at the time. I don't recall much from it. But Apple is always recommended
8550,"I think the 4s was a great phone. I still have 3 of them in my kitchen drawer, 2 actually still work! The phone was durable, fast, and brought a lot of new features. Everyone had one of these. It was a great buy then. Looking at it from a 2021 perspective, I cannot recommend the 4s for someone for obvious reasons, but the product did great at the time!"
8551,"El Apple iPhone 4S es una mejora del iPhone 4 que, manteniendo el diseño original, actualiza su hardware. Posee la misma pantalla de 3.5 pulgadas a 640 x 960 pixels de resolución, pero por dentro posee un procesador dual-core A5 que provee el doble de velocidad. Además sube su velocidad de conectividad hasta 14.4Mbps HSPA, incorpora una cámara de 8 megapixels con captura de video 1080p y corre el renovado iOS 5."
8552,Five came out so quick after 4S that I didn’t really have much of a chance to get to know this phone we were a one and done situation
8553,I was a blackberry girl and I got an iPhone as that was what everyone was doing. I regretted it shortly after and didn’t get one for 10 years almost.
8554,worst phone of my entire life. worked like crap and the battery lasted 10 minutes. do not recommend. waste of time
8555,"Despite its size, I loved this model, it was cute. I really loved it ❤️

did you have it? Do you love it as much as I do?"
8556,"I like that it was white, small and sleek. My hands are small so it made it easy til hold and manuever."
8557,"Best iPhone I ever had, also the first phone I ever had. It never cracked and survived so much of my middle school drama, friend of mine dropped it in the lake, saddest day of my life."
8558,Fue el primer iPhone que tuve con el tomé muy buenas fotos!! Me gusto muchísimo lo malo era que su botón del centro se dañó
8559,I loved this phone. It’s outdated for use now but and was the last “small” size phone that I used. That’s my main issue with it now is it’s outdated and too small with all these other phones out.
8560,Worked great for a long time. I had this phone until I finally upgraded to an iPhone 7. The only down fall is that once they start making more versions the older ones seem to stop working.
8561,My first iPhone. Had like 8gb. It was a good start. Minimal storage and features and it was time for it to retire.
8562,"I purchased this phone after having to visit the sprint store weekly to resolve issues with my android phone. After 15+ visits and 5 replacement phones they let me out of my contract early and I immediately purchased an iPhone based on my experience with other Apple products I’ve owned. There’s plenty of people with negative opinions about iPhones due to the operating system and the inability to customize various settings as you can with android. In my opinion the reliability and ease of use is definitely worth not having as much control over settings and being limited to things supported by iOS (I’ve never had problems with apps or something not working bc I have an iPhone). They’re a bit pricier but again it’s worth it to me, when I had my android I would be phoneless for days which isn’t ideal with a job and a kid."
8563,I loved my iPhone 4S. It was my first smartphone and I will buy Apple smartphones from now on.
8564,Very efficient and  sophisticated brand and lobg lasting I still have my 4s y'all lol I just need a charger still takes wonderful pictures in love with thw features many times I dream of going back to iPhones but it's very costly but one day one day
8565,This was my first iPhone and it lasted me for many years. I loved it so much. It was small and seemed almost indestructible. Eventually the speaker wore out so I had to replace it for a newer model.
8566,Looking back this phone wasn’t that good! But if you love Apple you stuck with this phone. Phone was definitely pricey for it’s time .
8567,"For its generation the phone was amazing. Its reliability now, no. It’s not reliable. The software is outdated. No I would not recommend this phone. For its generation yes it was easy. No I will not recommend it to others."
8568,"I got this the day it came out (since my previous phone had been stolen just a couple days before), and I loved it! Loved the thumb-print reader that made it so easy to unlock the phone. iPhones, in general, are great products. I just wish the battery had lasted longer than it did…and that there was more memory on the phon. I had the 36 (?) gig phone and it ran out of space after a few years of usage.

That said, once you switch to Apple, it’s hard to leave…

I’m on the iphone 11 right now…"
8569,"horrible, it was good a while ago but now you can't even use it, don't buy! it doesn't meet my expectation! i don't even think you can improve this item, not reliable, and don't recommend  for others to use."
8570,Phone was very heavy and bulky. Took great photos at the time but of course lots of models came after this one
8571,"The iPhone 4 was great when it first came out, but now that I’ve upgraded to an 8 I realized how bad the cameras in the 4’s were. As far as the layout they are pretty much the same. The 8 may be a little bit faster and have better graphics but other than that the iPhones haven’t changed a ton over the years."
8572,"Very small phone but I did use this when I was very young, not as an actual phone more for games. For what it was, it was perfect. Camera was fine, apps worked fine. I didnt use it much but it was ok."
8573,this was a good phone for the time that i had it which would of been when it first came out but now i would not recommend for anyone. it is not easy to use.  it’s slow.  it it will most likely just die. do not buy
8574,"My first iPhone and I loved it!! It’s still used by my little man to play music, take pictures and play games. An oldie but goodie!"
8575,This was my first telephone and my first official iphone. It did live up to the iphone hype & the Apple hype. It was good experience.
8576,"It was a great iPhone in its time, probably not as great now due to the newer iPhones having much better features. But it was small and easy to hold which was good. However it was also quite chunky and I’d say more fragile too."
8577,slow now a days you per much cant use them at all bc they crash and are slow quality isnt the best
8578,"This was my first phone. It was such an upgrade back then. Nice camera and software. I loved its size, so small yet so nice for my hand."
8579,"This was a good phone until it stopped getting the new iOS updates, and because the back of it was glass the back side of the phone cracked very easily"
8580,"That was my first apple product, i was so in love with cause it was so aesthetic, fast and simple, and i could download amazing games"
8581,This was my high school phone. Had it for 3 years. Very strong and was the best one few years ago.
8582,"Screen too small, but at the time of release it was fine as the new bigger screen iPhones have not been around yet."
8583,"this phone i was using in like 2015 so that was a long time ago but i still remember the good quality of it! the only negative thing that i'm gonna say, is that it's quite small. even for me and i don't normally mind small things. but i get that, it was invented a loong time ago and today's phones are looking much better."
8584,This phone was awesome when I got it an upgrade from my 3G phone and it was amazing!
8585,"My first iPhone and was great but the same problem, Pictures with no quality and slow but amazing in his times"
8586,"It was my first iPhone. I used for few years and it was top notch at the time. Just the battery was horrible, didn’t  last long, but I also loved the design of this phone. I love that the new iPhones have a similar design too."
8587,"Loved it while I had it. They were very tough, I had dropped it in water and it still worked. The apple brand is very exp"
8588,This was probably the only iPhone I ever bought Right after my blackberry broke. It was okay. Served its purpose. Not a fan of iPhone honestly. So as soon as I had the chance I went back to android and never looked back. To each their own.
8589,"This was my first smart phone. I think I bought it used, but I loved it. It was so much better than having my old flip phone.  The only thing I didn’t like about this phone was the multitask wasn’t that great. The apps would run slow"
8590,This was my first ever phone in 2013 i believe. Worked perfectly find back then! Now can't really use it anymore because it's a little too old generation but i still have keep it in case something would happen to my current iphone.
8591,"Este producto es demasiado Perfecto sobretodo cuando queremos algo natural, algo para el día a día"
8592,"Nice phone, back in the days when i used it, it was perfect, today it’s not working 🤣
Headphone jack, nice design and easy to use."
8593,"Would suit a you very child as a gateway phone, camera is not as good quality as modern phones."
8594,"Il est asser vieux comme téléphone et ça fait longtemps que je ne l ai plus utiliser mais je sais que l écran est fragile et que il y a pas mal de bug, il n y a pas non plus le mode ralenti en vidéo c est dommage mais a part ça il est bien mais je ne le recommmande pas plus que ça :)"
8595,One of the best apple phones I still own. Love the design and the durability of this model.
8596,Great work for years intell the updates than it started to mess up but still like the Apple product
8597,"Lo tengo desde hace varios años y me funciono perfecto, tiene muy buena cámara y las funciones son súper fáciles de usar el único problema que tuve fue con el almacenamiento de datos , se me lleno muy rápido pero puedes comprar espacio en la App Store y listo !"
8598,very very dissatisfied I don't know how many times it broke.  It barely lasted me a year.
8599,This was a good starter phone but it was too small. I was happy when apple began releasing larger phones. This phone was too much like a block in your hand.
8600,"En su momento fue uno de los mejores teléfonos. 
Fue el primer iPhone que tuve, y aún lo conservo. 
Es pequeño y practico pero ya ha quedado atrás con respecto a las nuevas versiones."
8601,It was a long long time ago but I really enjoyed my iPhone 4S it had great memory high speed I would have to say it was the best phone on the Shelf at the time I absolutely loved it it was no comparison 2 alternative smartphones
8602,Is a very good phone I bought it for my sister in law and she really liked it it last for long time and never had any problems
8603,Apple non delude mai. Tutti gli iPhone sono incredibilmente funzionali e super belli anche dal punto di vista estetico.
8604,This was the first iPhone I’ve ever had! It was so cool at the time and worked really well.
8605,Loved this phone.  I had it for over 5 years.  Only reason I needed a new one was cause I wanted an upgrade.  Battery got a little weak and memory was full but never had any problems with it.  Not practical anymore.  Very slow
8606,This was the first ever phone I ever had was extremely slow but when I look back it was extremely old and second hand as well
8607,It lasted me quite a while and it survived MANY falls. It did glitch quite often and it would freak out if I didn't download the updates it wanted. But overall it was a good phone. I really needed more memory space though.
8608,when i had the phone the glass was super fragile that it broke inside barely 24 hours of owning it
8609,"Credo che ormai sia fuori produzione😂
È stato il mio primo iPhone 
Ottimo prodotto , durato tanto 
Ho cambiato modello per il semplice fatto che ormai non supportava più aggiornamenti ma è ancora funzionante !"
8610,This phone was not secure at all anyone could go around your passcode to access your phone or guess your passcode. The phone was extremely small and hard to see. This phone was bulky with or without a case. I didn’t not like this iPhone at all.
8611,This is not a good phone. Not my favorite at all.  At the time yes. But right now nope.
8612,"This was my first experience with Apple products so it took me awhile to get accustomed to using it. But once I got used to it, I love it. Kept it until it wasn't able to update. Then moved to a 5."
8613,It’s a very old version of the iPhone!! It’s easy to put in your pocket!! Very easy to carry!!
8614,It small and hard to use because of the size of it but other Than that it’s ok. I. Would improve this product by make the size of it a little bigger and more storage
8615,The Apple iPhone 4S last iphone I owned. What I liked about the iPhone is that it was very user friendly. But I ended up jumping ship because I found the iPhone to be a big restrictive. If you want it easy to use smartphone with no learning curve the iPhone is it.
8616,I don’t like it because it’s way to small and it doesn’t take good pictures you can’t really do nothing on it you can’t even play iMessage games because it’s to old
8617,"Every year when apple comes out with a new phone, it gets better and better. I remember having the 4s and for the time, it was innovative. It met all expectations and though I don’t need to convince anyone of how good they are, I highly recommend Apple iPhone 4S"
8618,Je me rappelle très bien c'était quand j'étais en 6e j'avais ce téléphone pour mon tout premier téléphone à l'époque j'étais très heureuse d'avoir de téléphone maintenant quand j'y pense c'est un téléphone qui est assez petit mais qui fait l'affaire en cas de panne ou en cas de premier téléphone
8619,"Trop petit, assez lent, facilement cassable, mais joli design.          #apple #iphone"
8620,"It was ok when it first came out, but very out dated now. The screen is small and the shape of the new phones is better. The camera has also been improved significantly."
8621,I had this phone when it first came out and got on ok with it. It was fairly easy to use as a first time I phone user. The camera was of good quality and the pictures always came out really well. The only annoying thing i was found was that when connected to laptop it brought up I tunes each time and took ages to get rid of it. Evently the middle button at the bottom stopped working and was unable to use the phone
8622,"How I mentioned in the Iphone 6S Plus, I just had it 2 months and it is very useful too.
It is little, but useful, jaja."
8623,Love this Apple iPhone! After I switched from Samsung I would never go back. Love all the features and all the pictures come out beautiful.#Influenster ￼
8624,En su momento de lanzamiento fue genial ya para la actualidad es muy atrasado y con poca capacidad
8625,It’s definitely good for a starter phone or even for younger kids. It’s a lot smaller so if you can’t see very good or just like bigger phone then probably not the best but otherwise I never had any problems with it. Definitely recommend
8626,"This phone was junk. Picture quality wasn’t all that good, my apps always lagged, and towards the end of my use with it I was having so much technical difficulties, to the point where I couldn’t even use it. It was better than a flip phone though."
8627,De lo mejor compacto un poquitín pesado lo cuide al máximo sin problema alguno lo que más me gusto es su tamaño 👍🏼📱
8628,"I really liked the shape and size of this iPhone, I remember. It had good coloring, graphics, and speed at the time. I remember saying, at the time, that I always wanted my iPhone 4."
8629,great ios. i used this phone for almost three years. had great longevity. very user friendly.
8630,"I had this a long time ago, it doesn’t have memory, i had so little stuff and it always told me that I need space, I don’t recommend it, it’s slow"
8631,iPhone qui m’a servi pendant plus de 4 ans et étais toujours en bonne état ( le Nokia 3310 du futur)😂
8632,"En su momento estuvo super bien, muy caro, pero era la novedad, me costó al rededor de $12,000 en Mexico, duradero, hasta la fecha lo tengo y sigue sirviendo, me gusta el físico del iPhone, lo recomendaba en su momento"
8633,"Es un teléfono muy bueno, el único problema en este dispositivo es que se va des actualizando por su antigüedad"
8634,"tengo años con el celular,realmente al principio muy bueno pero debido a lo viejo esta lento, ya no actualiza ni descarga muchas de las aplicaciones y si sale de ellas, en si muchos errores y fallas.  Básicamente sirve para cosas esenciales como llamadas y mensajes."
8635,"This was the first iPhone that I’ve ever used in my lifetime. The design is amazing, and compact to hold. On top of that, battery life isn’t bad at all. But, the software is upgradable all the way up to iOS 7.1.2 which is now no longer supported since 2016 on most apps. Everything else performs decent at it’s time. Sure, it was 2010 so don’t expect anything better."
8636,"Este fue mi primer iphone, me pare muy bueno, solo que eran muy delicados y se rompían muy fácil sus cristales, pero eran la onda en su momento. Me encantaba."
8637,Omg Apple I phone make my life easy  easy to use and easy to download app highly recommend
8638,"This phone was good for the time, but now it's too old to keep up with the new iOS patches and the screen is way too small for most people's comfort. There are other options on the market now out there that are much more worth it. "
8639,"Cuando lo tuve, fue un dispositivo dentro de todo bueno y más actual aunque no me gustaba la calidad de sus fotos. Cuando los pasaba a pc e incluso cuando las tomaba las fotos no eran muy buenas y no me gusta el hecho que te obligaban a renovar de modelo sino no se actualiza las apps, eso es algo que jamás me gusta de apple en lo que es teléfonos. "
8640,This was my first phone and it was a pretty decent one. As it was my first phone i wasnt really knowledged on high tech as i was an 11 year old haha but from my knowledge i can recall this phone was pretty good to watch videos and play games like i did as an eleven year old. I would say now i think this phone would be very slow in contrast with the new apple releases and it would be pretty stressful to use.
8641,I mean if a compare it with my updated cell phones it can be pretty slow but it worked at the time and it was really in!
8642,This was a good phone when it was new it last a few drops before the screen broke. I kept this phone for two years before I got a new one because it became old
8643,"It’s not very fast and it’s sometimes hard to find suff, but it gets the job done. I personally liked it."
8644,"No era el mejor teléfono que había pero en su tiempo no era malo, dejo de servir hace apenas unos cuantos meses, más bien un año para ser más precisos, la cámara no es tan buena y se trababa un poco pero nada fuera de lo normal. 
No te lo recomendaría compra, pero ahora ya ni sirve, entonces pues bueno."
8645,"At the time it was an advanced device which was easy and simple to use, the build quality is excellent as to be expected from all apple products and held up to many years of use, I had no issues with the device only upgraded due to damaged screen (my fault) I would purchase another apple phone in the future"
8646,Great product amazing colour this brand works so great I recommend you all the quality of this product is a 9 out of 10
8647,Very old version. Gotta say it’s durable but the battery life sucks. Especially if it’s cold
8648,"Usei o aparelho por 6 anos e nunca me apresentou nenhum defeito, além da durabiliadade eu amei o design e a praticidade do desenvolvedor."
8649,"Era un celular agradable, me gustaba mucho su sistema. Con ese pequeño celular empecé a conocer apple y agradezco haber tenido ese celular"
8650,This was my first iphone ever! I will never forget how much time i spent just listening to music on my phone. This phone doesn't support netflix but it's totally fine. It works well until now. I use it as my backup phone specially when my other iphone is dead
8651,"It was nice at that time, i had it 2012.
It was my first iPhone, i liked it.
#iphone #apple
Apple iPhone 4S"
8652,"My first iPhone! Of course, by now I wouldn’t recommend you to buy it. But I really enjoyed it when it was 1st tech."
8653,It was good back in the days when I used it. But now it’s not stable like before. I still have it because i got some old pics which looks fire till today.
8654,SNCERAMENTE ME GUSTA MUCHO SU CAMAMRA LO UNICO MALO ES QUE SE PONE UN POCO LENTO Y SE LLENA SU MEMORIA MUY RAPIDO 
8655,"Cuándo lo tuve fue de lo mejor, me encantaba tenerlo, no sé si sigan vendiéndolos ya que el ios cambia y pierden actualización. Pero fue uno de mis mejores teléfonos."
8656,"mi experiencia con el 4S fue buena en su momento, pero es un celular antiguo que ya no tiene valor en el mercado mas que para utilizar algunas piezas, es facil de usar ya que es un modelo basico que todos conocen, pero realmente no lo recomiendo para hoy en dia "
8657,"Tenía muy poco almacenamiento, pero siempre fue un celular rápido, además su cámara era muy buena en esa época, pero era un poco pequeño, el diseño era muy bonito, me gustaba el vidrio que utilizaban, le daban mucha elegancia al celular, el cargador era un poco incómodo porque no era fácil de conseguir."
8658,Un aparato muy cómodo ya que es algo pequeño en cuestión de aplicaciones me gustaba lo cambie porque era difícil compartir cosas con smartfone 
8659,"lo tuve por allá del 2011-2012 jaja cuando estaba nuevo y ps wow era un gran cambio y avance tecnológico para la época, después de traer los típicos teléfonos con teclados que se abrían etc jaja y después en el 2018 estrellé y perdí mi iphone 6, y una amiga me prestó el 4, y pues me salvó por como un mes hasta que pude regresar a mi hometown y lo amé, aunque ya estaba un poco lento pero era muy practico para seguir comunicada!"
8660,"Para ser antiguo e smuy excelente, pero con el tiempo dejó de funcionar y las actualizaciones ya no estaban disponibles en su iOS"
8661,"Alot better quality than alot of brands today, very small and one of the worst batteries to date wish apple weren't scam artists and stopped updating them smh"
8662,"Diseño pequeño y elegante, al contar con cristal en ambos lados del equipo. Las funciones son adecuadas pero no actualizadas al año. Me encantaría volver a ver este modelo pero con actualizaciones 
"
8663,This phone was good but breaks really easily and water damage was a really big issue for me.
8664,Innovative brand of products Exelencia in its range are definitely geniuses the designers of this brand love each and every one of the products they sell widely recommended without mentioning that their products are made with the best existing materials each of its parts is made carefully they are a wonder I cannot die without first enjoying this eminence in products
8665,Era pequeño pero era lo que se buscaba en esas épocas. Muy practico y duradero debido a su forma compacta.
8666,"Beautiful phone. Nice cameras, enough storage, portable, fast and have quite nice view. I stayed with it for quite a long time until when I needed a change."
8667,"La verdad es que es un muy buen celular, su cámara es incomparable al igual que sus aplicaciones, 100% recomendado "
8668,pues hace unos años tuve uno y me duro como un año son muy fragiles pero valen la pena yo creo que es la mejor marca
8669,"Este fue mi primer celular iPhone, me lo regalo mi esposo en un aniversario y me encantaba! Tiene un sistema operativo súper rápido y una calidad que no se compara con ninguna otra marca, Apple es calidad garantizada"
8670,"en esos tiempos, me gustaba mucho su diseño, hasta la fecha creo que ha sido mi favorito de todos, era pequeño, cómodo y fácil de guardar."
8671,"Was cool when u still could do anything with it but as soon as the newer phones came the battery really sucked. 
The glass back is the worst tbh. It breaks sooo easily and can't be fixed very good. Also one of them blew for me."
8672,"Was an amazing phone for when I used it. Super small but it is old. However, I love apple products and will always use them!"
8673,Wouldn’t recommend this phone for this day and age. Very slow and limited features is a huge let down. Was very impressed by it when it first came out but now the battery life doesn’t last more than an hour.
8674,"Me gustaba mucho, fue el primer iPhone más estético y bonito. Nunca se descompuso, las funciones eran buenas y la cámara también"
8675,"It works until the last second, this was my first iPhone and I really love, it still have it￼￼. And I charge it still work I really love it.￼￼"
8676,Un buen celular me tardo alrededor de 6 años y lo@fue de utilizar porque se sobrecalentaba y la batería dejo de funcionar y pues no había remplazos 😔
8677,This phone lagged a lot. It was cool during the time but now it may have a lot of problems and may not be able to handle the new ios
8678,at the time i had this phone it was the coolest thing ever. it was my first phone and i had it for about 3-4 years before i completely shattered it. i thought it was so cool having the first phone with siri on it.
8679,I had this phone for 3 years!!! Never go back to Apple!!! Unfortunately I realised that giving so much money just for the external appearance.... Noo
8680,This was the first iPhone I had. It not only worked amazing but I loved how it fit really well in a pocket of a small purse especially compared to my current phone (iPhone XS)
8681,Been a crazy customer for Apple for so many years and sometimes absolutely love Apple products in the customer service and sometimes I just cannot believe that I spent so much money and some thing that it’s going to be completely obsolete in the next 10 months but I still do it and sometimes I still balance in over oh I like kids the majority of the time my products besides the fact that I am trapped and have to keep purchase the nails update product or delays my product is going to be so slowly that I will lost my freaking patient
8682,"In contrast price quality are very good and durable. I like designs are very comfortable an very good product. I improve The price for more accessible to the people. The sound it's very good nice , yes I buy this product all of my life, I like this"
8683,This one was a very great phone when I bought it and 6 years later it still works but I have another one just because technology has improved a lot since then. I don’t even think you can still buy this so maybe this review is pointless.
8684,so small camera barely worked and was so hard to type i hated this phone and it’s so old
8685,"Not my favorite phone. It did not last me more than a year.  I hated that I could not control the updates since the updates seem to make my phone more and more outdated. Not worth the money. Every Samsung phone I've had has lasted me at least two years, so this one was a disappointment."
8686,"I would say this one was one of the best iphone in regards of size, pocket size thick enough i dropped it several times and it didn’t broke at all."
8687,At the time this model was around it was one of the best phones. Now however it’s outdated but I loved it while I had it.
8688,"For the time, this phone was perfect. It was my first smartphone & it honestly had such amazing durability. I’m sure you can find one that still works perfectly today."
8689,"If it still works good for you. Was great when I got one in 2011, wouldn’t use one anymore since most apps won’t work on the OS."
8690,This was my first Apple phone that I ever received! I was Over the moon and so excited that I finally owned an apple product haha
8691,"It was my first Apple phone. I kept it for 4 years. 

It was good even if the pictures quality was not good. But I fell in love with IOS that's what made me stay at Apple and made me want to buy another model of phone : Apple iPhone 6"
8692,"Apple's over-the-phone tech support provides correct answers in a timely manner, though one of its recurring issues is still there. ... After that, Apple's phone-based customer support proved that it's still able to answer questions in a friendly manner without making you wait."
8693,"De los mejores teléfonos que ha sacado la apple, muy resistentes, en sus tiempos era lo máximo"
8694,"Hello, iPhone lovers, I had 4s 8 years ago, It had problems with battery, wireless connections and also frame was thinner and was not strong. It was broke while I was using case."
8695,This product is very helpfull and very amazing 😍😍😍😍This product is very helpfull and very amazing 😍😍😍😍This product is very helpfull and very amazing 😍😍😍😍This product is very helpfull and very amazing 😍😍😍😍This product is very helpfull and very amazing 😍😍😍😍
8696,I phone it’s the best for me I like taking selfies so it’s cool I use the back camera but I need to upgrade soon not sure what one I want yet but I phones are the best ....
8697,This was my first ever iPhone. Looking back now being that I have a 8 plus I don’t even know how I ever used that small of a phone. It was a great first smartphone to have and Apple is the only brand of cells phones I will use.
8698,Button started getting lose and eventually stopped working. Storage not great on it either
8699,"El iphone 4s es el mejor teléfono del mundo amo la marca apple me encanta el sistema apple 
su cámara, pantalla soy muy fiel a esta marca porque me hace sentir mas segura en el sistemas de seguridad corro peligro  que no cualquiera te puede robar el teléfono  "
8700,Slow and the camara is pretty bad but considering the time it came out it’s actually really good
8701,"One of my first mobile phones and my absolute favourite , very sturdy and has all of the applications I could’ve needed at the time ."
8702,My first iPhone I got was this one! It worked great for the many years I had it! No problems at all!
8703,"My first Apple Iphone , i love it. And never go back or find other brand than iPhone."
8704,"Got this iphone when it first came out.  It was a great model.  It was small and a little clunky compared to the newer versions, but it was great for what it was.  I really enjoyed it and it lasted a long time."
8705,This was my favorite phone because of the size and the button! I loved that it could fit in my smaller bags but still had all the features that I needed.
8706,It was really good at that time.I dropped it and it was still working.Camera quality was bad as the battery life.I would not buy this cause we are in 2020.
8707,This was my favorite iPhone! It fit perfectly in my small hands and was so easy to use when multitasking. Wish they made phones still that small.
8708,"This was my 1st iPhone.  It took some getting use to (how to operate it, using the apps, etc.) but it was user friendly. Unfortunately , the speaker died a couple of years later & I sold it to gamestop."
8709,This was my very first phone and I loved it. It meet all expectations worked great! No room for improvement. It’s lasted me years before I had to upgrade due to it being slow. Only downfall was front and back being both glass.
8710,"this was my very first phone from apple. it was personally one of my favourites, especially because the back of it was made of glass. it was very luxurious, felt expensive, but somewhat small to what they offer now. at the time though it was the perfect little iPhone to fit into the back of your pocket! "
8711,Apple is the leading brand of phones are the market! I love the processing system they use! But they are outrageously priced.
8712,"Apesar da telinha ser bem pequenininha, o sistema era muito bom até nessa época, a camera frontal não mas a traseira era exeleeente"
8713,Was a great phone I was unsure at first but I’ve stocked with the iPhone all these years now and have thoroughly enjoyed them.
8714,When I had this phone I really loved it. The size of it is great and fits perfect in your hand! Loved the lock button being in the top!
8715,It was a good phone. Easy to use and organize. Mine lasted a long time until the speakers finally quit working after years.
8716,It was good for it’s time but I wouldn’t buy it or recommend it considering all the stuff we have now. It’s super slow now as well plus the screen was tiny
8717,It is great like all of the Apple products are. I loved this phone when I was younger!
8718,From what I remember this was a good phone. I had it so long ago. Upgraded after 2 years
8719,"The most basic of the iphones, but innovative in its day. Now in 2020 it would more likely be used as a relic or a paper weight than an actual cellular device"
8720,This was my favorite one by far.. just for the fact I have such small hands this phone fit perfectly in them!
8721,Oh my gosh thinking back to when I had my Apple iPhone 4S. It was a good phone and at the time it was actually a great phone but now I don’t even know if it would work LOL￼
8722,This was one of my first smartphones. It lasted me forever and I used it for everything. The camera quality is great for the generation of phone. However compared to new models it’s very small and bulky.
8723,Apple over all is a great company and thinks about every single detail to possibly help a coustomrs life on a day to day basis. I know this because I have used these produce my whole life of having tech
8724,"Again this one isint bad, I liked it but again the screen now makes these incomparable."
8725,"We had our iPhone 4s for 5 years  a while back when we had them until the screen went green and stopped working , then we moved up to a 6s phone ."
8726,"It was a good phone at its time, however it will not be compatible with any new iOS updates. If you are getting an iPhone get a least an 8 and up."
8727,"I bought this phone a long time ago. when I bought it was very helpful for me, but in few months after the battery was running fast and this really bother me."
8728,Not the best phone but it worked. I didn’t like that Apple tried to play up very basic features in this model that other brands already had for a while.
8729,"My iPhone 4 was purchased used for $50 from my husband’s job. I used it for many years before upgrading to a used iPhone 6. I liked it, but needed a bigger screen. The camera was really good on it."
8730,I had this iPhone when it came out and it would smash all the time I constantly got new screens
8731,They don’t last very long but if your looking for something small and simple than this may be for you
8732,Had this phone as my first phone. It was great for the time but could definitely not survive in today’s phone expectations.
8733,I had this phone for at least two years . FaceTime was the best feature tied w/Siri! Apple is always on the cutting edge of great technology! I love iPhone! It’s the only phone I’ve bought in the last few years.
8734,Had this phone years ago but I think it’s the first one that had the front camera which was so amazing when it first came out! The amount of pictures I had on that thing was crazy!
8735,It was good for a first iPhone but it was so small and hard to use that I’m glad I got an upgrade
8736,I had this phone years ago. It was a great cell phone then and its predecessors are also wonderful. If you have not tried Apple products I can definitely vouch for this product. You will love using them!!!!! .
8737,"This phone is not that good compared to new phones. It is so tiny and barely works. I can see everything so much worse than I could a newer phone. Also, no face id is something I really dislike on the 4! It has a crappy camera and I’d recommend a newer phone to everyone!"
8738,Apple can hardly get it wrong when it comes to the iPhones.  They work seamlessly with other Apple products.
8739,I’ve had every new iPhone for the most part. It’s a reliable phone and easy to use. I don’t go for the big hype of getting every new phone of the company but i don’t see myself switching.
8740,It’s trash now but every apple product has amazed me at its first year out of the store.
8741,This was my second iphone and it was definitely nicer looking with the glass compared to the 3gs but did not hold up well at all!! I completely gave up over time with fixing the screen. Glad they improved majorly since then. Wouldn’t recommend.
8742,"First let me say... I love this product ! it's amazing.. i really like it so far, i will work with it many times because it have a big importance it facilitates work with her high quality so I validate it and confirmed"
8743,"Ever since iPhones came out, I’ve only been using iPhones. Definitely more user friendly compared to the galaxy phones. The camera is getting much better, but the iPhone itself is getting more expensive which is the only down side for me."
8744,Was good back in the hay day. Jake was a great night and yummy beer selection good beer and beer
8745,"El mejor teléfono que tuve , súper resistente, nunca se me daño. Le cambie algunas veces la batería pero de resto funcionaba excelente. Se los recomiendo al cien por ciento."
8746,"Su interfas me agrada ya que tiene un estili sencillo pero elegante, el teléfono no se trabaja para nada, tiene lo necesario"
8747,The original iPhone that came with all glass it’s very small and easy to break because it’s all glass
8748,"I have about the oldest iPhone and need a new one, when I first got this one it was incredible the camera was amazing and everything, now all it is like recording on a potato not very nice anymore."
8749,I ran through about 3 of these phones before I realized how low quality it was! In apples defense it is a very old model compared to what is available now. Not something I would ever purchase again...
8750,Very small phone I had just love it cuz of size and yea it is and not much to say cute and yes before others came out needs more improve and affordable
8751,"I had it for  3 years, and the phone itself was very durable, didn’t give me any problems. Overall it was a great phone but it did get slow overtime"
8752,"La verdad en aquel entonces cuando salió era buenísimo, está con ganas y si estaba un poquito caro pero pues digamos que si valía la pena y la cámara era buenísima para aquel tiempo obviamente, tenía bastantes apps"
8753,"It seems so long ago that I used this phone, but I was overall satisfied....very easy to use. Most Apple products are. There have been so many improvements made since this phone. I’d consider it affordable and definitely recommended it back in the dat!"
8754,"First Apple phone I ever had. I loved it. For what it was, it was amazing. Worked quickly. And I just wanted to be in with the people of course. But great phone. Steve Jobs is from another world."
8755,the iphone 4s was one of my first phones and it lived up to its expectations after it was released. apple always goes above and beyond
8756,This was my very first iPhone it made me not want to go back to a android ever again.
8757,"I loved loved loved this phone. I had it for a total of six years￼. I’m one of those people who is determined to use the phone until it’s just not usable anymore.￼ After six years and so many updates mine finally just couldn’t cut it anymore. The battery started to get worse, but I think it’s because the apps were becoming more advanced and using more memory and it was just really hard for my phone to keep up. But to get six years out of a cell phone in this day and age is amazing and I really got my moneys worth out of it￼."
8758,"Best apple phone ever created!!! It has at least 5 years with me and if it wouldn't be cause the CDMA system is becoming obsolete with these phone it would still be working. No matter how many times it fell down ,it always was good and it was very resistant ,battery lasts a lot! In difference to current models . They should keep doing the phones with that same quality"
8759,"Obvio un gran modelo en su tiempo, me gustaba que no era tan grande y cabía perfectamente en mis manos, empece con el 3 pero siempre me gustan las innovaciones de apple"
8760,Since 2012 it's backup phone Apple are resistant damage no update last generation but large storage capacity and picture at the top
8761,"It was my very first iPhone. I have plenty of photos and old apps in that phone to this day. I do not use it now as a actual phone, but great to store old photos"
8762,It was my second phone and I thought it was a good phone but I really didn’t have to upgrade from my 4 since it was almost the same
8763,This was my first iPhone. I honestly loved it because it was the highest tech/ nicest phone I ever used. Loved this phone!
8764,This was my first smartphone back in the day. Siri was a brand new feature and so that was pretty cool. Great phone in 2011.
8765,"This phone was cute when they first came out. However, as apple released new phones, my phone got slower and the battery would die so quickly. The camera quality was terrible. Would not recommend if you can even still buy it."
8766,"At the time when I bought it it was the best, it is a smart phone with an incredible space, really good cell phone"
8767,"Stopped using because it wouldn't update anymore.  It was a good phone a long time ago. Wouldn't buy it now.
"
8768,"The iPhone 4S is the follow-up to the very popular iPhone 4 and features a faster Apple A5 dual-core processor and improved 8 megapixel camera. The iPhone 4S also features Siri - a voice assistant heeding natural-language questions and commands, and taking dictation. Other features of this smartphone include a gorgeous 3.5-inch high-resolution display, full web browser, Bluetooth compatibility, music player, Wi-Fi. The most brilliant Iphone ever made!"
8769,"This was my first iPhone. I used it for a couple of years then handed it down to my husband when I upgraded. He used it for years and would still be using it except it's no longer able to be upgraded to the current iOS.
"
8770,"This phone was fun. The system ran flawlessly. Netflix on it looked awesome. I'm not sure if there are anymore in the market. Good times. I recommend this product.
"
8771,Good for someone switching to a smartphone . Easy to understand . Small enough to fit in jean pocket. My microphone stopped working on mine . At the time a bit pricey but not bad. Not much need for it since new Iphones  are out to upgrade
8772,"Good solid phone, used it for 3 years and could still turn it on and use today. Reliable"
8773,My mom had this phone it boy it was one of the strongest phones .. it would fall and not break and it was easy to use
8774,"Es un buen celular como todos los productos de apple, simplemente pues van saliendo mas nuevos y ahí que cambiar"
8775,"This is probably the worst phone I’ve ever had. Dropped it once and it completely shattered. I’m so glad the new phones are a little better quality. Screen would glitch out, but that’s expected from an older phone."
8776,Besides it being an apple this this is as unbreakable as the old nokias😂😂 but the phone was laggy and had limited storage space for my taste
8777,"First iphone and had it for 2 years, thank god I had insurance on it because I had to replace it 17 times in those 2 years. Other than that it was cute I guess. "
8778,This was my first ever smart phone and I love it. It was the perfect size and it was highly functioning. I love the camera! I would improve this product by making it a little bigger. It is very affordable and apple always takes the extra step to make it even better!
8779,If I remember right this is my favorite one and it seems like every other # iPhone is really great. They  think they need a new one every year which they don’t it’s ridiculous. I do not use Siri at all now but I think she was the best on that one
8780,This was tiny and chunky! This was my first apple product! Had this for the first two years of high school! It always lagged and had bad photo quality.
8781,The 4s my first and best iPhone. I only upgraded when it became necessary. The battery life was great and it was incredibly sturdy. It hooked me on Apple and Mac for good. I wish my newer iPhone was as strong.
8782,I love my iPhone. Got mine since the original back in 2008 or 2007. Disappointing that the battery life last two years before it starts draining so quickly. It’s a tool used to get you to buy another
8783,Old phone does the job when it first came out it was the best of its kind being reliable but chunky and easily broken or smashed. I’ve always found apple easy to use
8784,"Broke so easily and quickly but really great regardless, it’s nice to have a home buttton."
8785,"I loved my 4S. Despite it being smaller than current phones, it satisfied my phone needs and had a fantastic battery life."
8786,I only used this type of phone once my boyfriend had found one at the beach and who gave it to me I use it for a couple of months but I did not like it because IOS had deleted all my pictures in my information and I did not know anything about this phone I was very mad about it but after I decided never to perches in iPhone and I have never owned 1 ever sees they tend to break so fast when they fall compared to a Samsung
8787,"When I bought this phone, it was brand new and had all the great new features, but as newer models came out, it started to slow down like all Apple products do. 
"
8788,"The iphone 4s was my best phone but nowdays i dont use it, iphone 4s was so simple and easy at evreything and i also loved the ios 6,i would improve this product by improve the size personally i found that he is little  and i think that this phone have a good processor and a good ram but the camera is too bad,if this product is really upgraded in term of  size,camera,cpu and ram it ll be a good phone but as we all know the iphone 4s isn't good for nowdays apps  so i ll not recommend it to any one
"
8789,It got too slow there at the end and I think that Apple does that intentionally to their products honestly.
8790,"Muy bueno me gusta mucho Apple Ya me acostumbre a su sistema operativo, lo malo que en un cierto tiempo ya no se actualiza el sistema eso no me gusta ya que los nuevos aparatos tienen un precio elevado a veces es complicado comprar uno y eso lo hace ver innecesario. "
8791,I have loved all of the iPhones. I’ve gotten them since they came out. I love how they get thinner with bigger screens each year. Our family is 100% Apple! So user friendly
8792,This was my very first iPhone & I loved it!! It was very reliable and it didn’t give me any problems I didn’t need any improvements but apple came out with bigger and better things. I would recommend this phone for your kids but I don’t know if they still make these.
8793,"My very first iPhone. It’s what turned me to the apple life. It was very durable and lasted a while, until it was ran over by a semi."
8794,"This was the first iPhone I ever got. My dad bought me it. I had it for over 2 years I always kept a case on it so it was like new. 

Battery life stayed good, smaller than the rest and thicker as it’s an older model but still great"
8795,This was my first iPhone. This phone lasted 4 years. It was a great phone and it’s the phone to convince me to be an iPhone user for life.
8796,"I had a 4S last year and it lasted for about a month 
No matter what I did, it would just overheat constantly. I would factory reset it, only add one app, and it would tell me that there's no storage and it would just flash the overheating screen despite the fact that the phone is cool to the touch. Nothing fixed it and Apple said it had to be my fault. The battery life is terrible and my wifi dongle broke on it. worst phone ever...."
8797,It’s a good phone for kids can’t do much compared to the newer iPhones but it’s ok 👍🏻👍🏻
8798,Ok if anyone’s thinking about buying this just no🤦🏼‍♀️ don’t even. It’s a 4s granite mine did last a good 4 yrs it was the most annoying thing ever. It took 30 seconds to take a picture. The screen is tinier then a flip phone and it cracks so easily. The battery dies in 2 seconds and the buttons actually click! U won’t b able to have new emojis or Snapchat filters or any good updates bc the phone is so far behind. Just please leave the iPhone 4 back in 2012

8800,"This was my first iPhone ever and I completely fell in love with it. It worked perfectly, but it was about 3 years later that the battery started to last way too little and I had to charge my phone at least 3 times a day. It was a bummer because I did love it."
8801,This was my first smart phone and I only use Apple products because of this phone. I loved how small it was and how it could fit anywhere.
8802,"My husband bought this for me .i am not crazy about apple products .becoz I find them they are not user friendly.for every thing you have to use iTunes. It doesn’t have mass storage mode . **Micro-SIM card support**- Micro-SIM cards are still not very common in our market so you have to cut your normal SIM by SIM cutter. The cut SIM may not work properly in iPhone and in that case you have to ask your service provider to arrange one micro-SIM. No FM radio**- It may not be a major limitations but still one expects this basic feature when investing to much money in a phone. There are many radio apps available but will only work with mobile data or Wi-Fi.
Good things about this is Retina display Reading on iPhone is a pleasure to eyes.
camera is very fast** and clicks without much hassles. The **touch is very smooth** and the performance is blazing fast.Apple iPhone 4S"
8803,"I have this iPhone and it was my first one. It’s small and not big like my iPhone 7, but it did the job at the time. Very reliable and still going strong after a few years and I let the grandsons play games on it. Never had a problem with it and highly recommend this."
8804,"I absolutely loved owning the iPhone 4S. I remember getting it within a few days of its release and kept it until it finally fell on the pavement the wrong way. It worked great considering when it was out and in public use, but the battery life was always a problem and I had to keep a charger nearby always."
8805,"In its day this phone was great, now comparing to the newer models it's slow and brick-like. But there are some good things about the 4s like, unlike the new screens and structure these phones don't break in easy and they are more than half the price of a newer model. If you find a new phone they are quite good but after a couple of years, they are slow, don't work and eventually become obsolete. "
8806,Had this phone before! Very first iPhone I had! Great phone loved it did everything but of course as the new ones come out they get better and better!
8807,This was my first apple product. I loved it with all the cool features and apps I couldn’t get on my previous android phone. I loved the size as I have small hands. The phone lasted me 4 years which is impressive
8808,I really love this phone it is amazing I use it almost every day. The camera on it is great and works well I take photos with it all the time. I would recommend this to anyone who loves phones that don't get viruses easily.
8809,I remember this phone was so hyped up back in I believe 2012-2013. It lasted me only 2 years until I got tired of this version and wanted a new 1. The only thing I'm not too fond with iPhone is that they can break very easily . I wish they weren't so expensive .
8810,"el celular fue bueno hablando de bajar apps hasta que ya no pudieron o no fueron compatibles con este modelos en el 2017 , pero juro que me agaunto caidas descragas electricas la pila sigue intacta ,la memoria de almacenaje era util buena grande, saca buenas fotos nitidas y sin movimiento a pesar de no ser el ultimo modelo de apple no lo hubiera cambiado si no fuera por las apps porque hasta el tamaño lo hacia practico en el bolso de los jeans porque jamas me lo robaron  y su grosor resistente el color blanco de la carcasa me parecia elegante la pantalla jmas se le rompio y eso que se me cayo de un primer piso o tuve suerte o es este modelo un robocop indestructible que aun guardo en mi cajonera

8814,"This little guy got me through several years and still ran fast, still got every single little update, still did everything that was supposed to do despite being dropped constantly by me as a teenager."
8815,I had mine for 5 years and it still works fine. I just wish my photos weren’t deleted. Every strong only broke after 4 years.
8816,"this was my second phone i believe and it was great! for the time it came out it was super cool. it has lots of app selections and the camera isn’t all that bad. the price at the time was pretty good. if your getting this now it’s also pretty good, you can’t update it anymore which sucks but for taking videos and pics it’s good, playing games it’s also good, calling and texting it’s amazing for since you really get grip when holding the phone. i recommend if you can get it for around 100$ or less"
8817,"My first iPhone that I ever got was the iPhone 4s and that had been my upgrade from a blackberry pearl.

8820,I used to have this phone when it first came out. I liked it but it was not great safari was okay. I did not like the thickness and the size of it. Although I liked that the battery would last long and I would not have to charge it more than twice a day.
8821,"I had an iPhone 4s for the longest time ever, not until a few years ago I upgraded to the iPhone 6. I had no issues with the 4S, it worked and still works fine, no crashes nothing. A bit small for my liking but overall a good phone."
8822,"Love me some macbook pro laptops & mac tech products in general!!. A little pricey for what you get internally, but the outside look is sleek and and sexy as ever! SUPER user friendly in my opinion, especially for people who arent extremely tech saavy. Ive loved all my macbooks Ive owned. Thumbs up!"
8823,never had a problem with my iphone. wish i could still used it. love the size and color. easy to use do recommend it
8824,"I was never keen on what everyone else has so I'd have the opposite and have a Samsung but then I decided to go for an I phone  4 for my first. 

Never regretted it 

I would recommend to anyone great quality but pricey but you could always buy a second hand one if you were not keen on price"
8825,"Tengo varios años con mi teléfono. Obvio si es bueno pero odio su cámara frontal, todas las fotos por ahí salen feas. Pero de resto mi teléfono se ha portado muy bien."
8826,"I had been looking for a replacement iPhone 4S since I accidentally drowned my original Verizon purchase and ruined it. A Verizon Wireless rep suggested that used phones purchased through one of Amazon's used item stores where probably a safe bet. Referencing an email from Amazon based on my past searches, I looked at the phones sold by Amazon Warehouse Deals.

This was a used phone, packed in the original Apple sealed packaging. No problems, cosmetic or otherwise. Phone was easily set up and activated without any assistance from Verizon Wireless service reps.

When activating your phone to replace the dead phone, be sure to use the ""Reset to Factory Settings"" option under settings which essentially makes your used iPhone a ""new"" phone. I also found my current iCloud backup on the phone and restored that so that my apps and contacts would be current.

Dialing *228 from the new phone will contact Verizon Wireless and activate the replacement iPhone. You will be prompted for the number of the phone you are replacing and the last four digits of your Social Security number to verify you are the legit owner of the account (you were asked for this info when the account was created). In a few seconds, your new phone will be activated and ready to use.

There is no need to follow the documented iTunes activation procedures to get the replacement phone online.

Regardless of what other articles say, there was no need to know the ESN (MEID) of the old or new phones or remove the battery to find this info (note that a charged iPhone displays its MEID under settings).

8828,"Taking into account the dimensions of the screen, its dual camera, powerful processor and battery life , as well as increased storage capacity and Internet access of some of its models, the iPad mini looks with advantage over devices as the Kindle Fire or the Nexus 7. ​​to this we must add the availability of applications for the Apple iOS store, which outperforms Android .

But not all have is positive. As we discussed in our article on rumors of iPad mini, one of the important elements in defining their supremacy over the other tablets that we have quoted was the price . In this Apple has invested heavily , charging a premium for quality and brand. However, it is difficult to decide which would be better, if you buy a Kindle Fire at $ 199 or $ 329 iPad mini in , so the decision will ultimately depend on how loaded is our pocket."

8831,very comfortable to use and I'm anxious to try the new ones like the iphone 7 and 8.. so yeah thats my revew
8832,"I have used this cellphone in 2016., years after it was first released, and even after so many years, this phone was working excellent. Had a good camera, front was a bit grainy, but lets be real, it's an old phone. Fast while using, and practic. Only issue with this phone was battery which was usually draining real fast. Overall, nice little phone."
8833,"this is the phone that is currently used, has lasted for many years, the battery is running out quickly and no new updates come out which I do not like"
8834,"wooow i love it My only dream is to buy a phone. I tried all the mobile phones such as Samsung, Sony, and many more but I did not find iPhone, they are all imitators, I am a girl, my dream is a phone and the iPhone is my dream. I really really like this product and I want to buy it. In the undisputed world and This is my phone at the moment. i got it the day it came out and defiantly don't regret the purchase. its like a dream i'am really love it i'am fall in love with this phone "
8835,I have this phone but now I don't use it because I believe that there are much better smartphones out there.
8836,"Okay, first of all, I've had this phone for about 3 years and its great. It's not as fast as the new phones, and definitely not as thin, but I like it because it actually feels like I'm holding something sturdy. It still is getting software updates and is working great despite its age. Highly recommend to everybody! Don't think judge a book by its cover"
8837,"Son teléfonos fieles! Yo tengo más de 6 años con el mío y aún está intacto! Eso Sí, lo cuido mucho! No me hace falta cambiarlo! Para mí este modelo sigue siendo perfecto"

8841,"I had the worst time with this phone. I had two before I went over to the Galaxy s6. Both iPhones had the same problem, the speakers stopped working so I wasn't able to talk to people on the phone because I wasn't able to hear them."
8842,I had it for 2 years and worked really well! The camera was good but I had a problem with the storage bc when you buy it you can use from 8 gb only 5
8843,"Take still images dynamically; At the time of recording video in Full HD at 1080p, does not lock.
The battery is super durable, it is a rugged equipment, the size of the screen is ideal, for me it was a faithful phone. Must improve with frequency

"
8844,A few months ago I had this iPhone 4S and I thought it was a good one the battery lasted for days it had great applications in it and it was simple and easy to use the best feature is the camera and Siri it was very useful
8845,"First iphone I had, few years ago. User friendly, great apps, only problem I had was the home button. I had to bring it back to an apple store to repair it. I was lucky I got a brand new phone instead. "
8846, el equipo es muy bueno para las personas que no necesiten tanto sistema o tanta cosa por lo que en tenido un iphone 4s de 8g es muy bueno por es compacto para lo que tiene ademas es uno de los mejores dispositivos de el año en que lo sacaron a la ven el mejor
8847,"No lo he tenido para mí, pero, en la opinión de mis amigos, me dicen que es excelente, muy buena cámara, súper cómodo y muy fácil de usar"
8848,This iPhone I liked a lot for its size and its storage capacity which is not very nice is the quality of the camera
8849,When this phone was up to date it sucked. I always had technical problems with it and the battery had to be on the charger 24/7. Today it's non-functional.
8850,IPhone device one of the most powerful smart phones in the world of a small device and very fast in a wonderful games and Internet and a very distinctive camera and powerful device is small and distinctive
8851,"Sabes que tienes un teléfono inteligente cuando tienes un iPhone, no importa qué modelo es, iPhone es iPhone. Espero pronto actualizar mi dispositivo para seguir las innovaciones que han creado. 
Utilicé el Samsung Galaxy S3 durante mucho tiempo, fui a reparar en varias ocasiones y la verdad es que mi iPhone, aunque es un poco anticuado, se mantiene en el tiempo y operando a través del sistema que soporta las actualizaciones iOs. Fue la mejor inversión"
8852,"Es un buen producto tiene una buena bateria,su camara es mejor que las de otros celulares de gama alta ,tiene muy buenas especificaciones ,tiene bastantes actualizaciones ,es muy barato y tiene una buena pantalla,lo recomiendo para otras personas ."
8853,"To
 be honest, one of the nicest and best phones available for Apple 
because it is very easy and why we do not get to do a review even though
 I own it and love it so much"
8854,I would say I used this phone for about 2 years. It served well but it's memory didn't. The storage on the phone is too small. The cost was reasonable when i had bought mine. I think they could increase the storage and upgrade the ios version for that phone. 
8855,The iPhone 4s is almost indestructible but it has terrible camera quality. The phone is extremely expensive for the poor quality your receiving. It did not reach my expectations however it was reliable. Apple could have improved on so much but they did a decent job.
8856,"I love This product From Apple , and I would like to review in my Channel in Youtube with my subscribers, and thanks very much  "

8858,you can't have this phone and have all the apps you want anymore. real disappointing that they do it like that. 
8859,"This iPhone is not so good, the resolution of the camera is more or less, the operating system becomes somewhat slow and that is something that stresses people, having to deal with a slow phone. Obviously at the time this phone was a boom, for the simple fact of being an iphone, but there are better phones than the iPhone 4S"
8860,"I have the 16 GB Space Grey Unlocked version. I have never been a fan of iPhones and this is my first one. Let me be honest, I only bought an iPhone because i could not find a good replacement for my previous HTC One X+. As someone switching from the Android platform, i had a lot of trouble copying my contacts and photos. Having to depend on ITunes etc to copy music to my phone puts me off. The battery seems to last ok..nothing to write home about for someone who does spend a considerable amount of time browsing on my phone. The photo quality is good and the iPhone makes life easier if family and friends are also users of Apple products since Face Time and Air Drop features are very convenient. 

Overall would switch back to Android the next time i am in the market for a new phone."
8861,"Where do I start with this phone...
I received it as a gift 3 years ago and since then it has fallen countless times (with a protective case on) and took a tumble in the ocean. The tumble in the ocean waves caused the flash to stay on for a week after which time I had to kill it and the camera stopped working for about 5 months - bear in mind that I live in a country where there is no Apple Repair Store.
After that the camera became functional again and the phone still works amazingly well, all things considered."
8862,I've had ad this model for a few years. It works really well. The screen is small but I don't mind. It's a bit outdated though. Mine won't update anymore and therefore I can't get new apps. I will probably pass this onto one of my kids instead of getting them a new one.
8863,I had this phone for a year and it shattered while in a case. It was affordable but since it is an older model does not work as well as it used to anymore which is expected. I would recommend this phone although it is a little outdated.
8864,"Rubbish phone with rubbish features and interface. For a brief moment in time 7days to be exact, I went over to the dark side and used an iphone never again. Over rated phone. Same applies for the new releases as well."
8865,"This was one of my favorite phones, it was very good super fast, agile of a comfortable size for me, it was certainly fabulous had a lot of memory capacity could lower the amount of app I wanted the only thing I did not like much was the quality Of the front camera but the rest was excellent. I would love to try the iphone 5 or 6
"
8866,"Buen teléfono, saca fotos aceptables, buena calidad del material de construcción. Tiene buen sonido, pero no se puede actualizar más allá del ios 7, lo cual deja en desventaja al adquirir aplicaciones."
8867,Iphone 4s was the best iPhone I'd ever had. I loved the the design and the size of iPhone 4s. Perfect for my petite hands and would never have to worry if it was too big to hold or I might drop it. I also liked how glass looking does it look. I used a back screen protector to stick on the back of the phone and I didn't even need a phone case to have my phone protected. Siri was first added in this iPhone that has been my lifesaver. I could use my voice to control the phone. And I like Slice of Answer function more than fingerprints forced touch which I barely use on the new iPhone 7
8868,"Its so good smartphone, i always recommend iphone product if someone ask about the best quality phone 👍👍
Even i know u will never send me too review i still recommend this to all my friend"
8869,"I had a 4S a long time ago. It lasted a week. 
No matter what I did, it would just overheat constantly. I would factory reset it, only add one app, and it would tell me that there's no storage and it would just flash the overheating screen despite the fact that the phone is cool to the touch. Nothing fixed it and Apple said it had to be my fault. So I switched to Android and I have never looked back. I'm getting the Galaxy A5 2017 next week and I'm so hype. "
8870,Hated it. It had alot of problems. It wasnt easy to use. It brome extremely easily. Jist not my favorite especially for the price.
8871,Hello I love the iphone I would like to send it to me ago a review on my youtube channel I love its vercion and the way it works I had an iphone 5 but if it broke me and I would love to send me this iphone to put it Try and give feedback on the many thanks for replying 
8872,"Es un excelente telefono, toma fotos de excelente calidad, captura momentos, es una herramienta muy util para los estudiantes ya que puedes ver trabajos por medio de el, tiene Siri el cual es una maxima ayuda cuando no puedes escribir, de verdad lo recomiendo muchisimo"
8873,"My very first iPhone was the 4s and I loved it. The size of this iPhone seems extremely small to the models they are making today. However, I think its still a great phone. The camera and photo quality I find is not as good as the newer models but if you want an iPhone at a cheaper cost I would recommend this one. "
8874,"This was the first iPhone I had, it lasted quite a while but now a days when I went to use it, omg it's crap, it's very slow, the calling doesn't work really good, can barely hear the other person on the line, if your thinking of getting this iPhone, DONT!"
8875,"So small and pure trash. Takes terrible pictures, and has no storage! The uodates were annoying because i had to keep deleting my pictures to get enough storage to update my phone"
8876,This phone lasted me about 4 years. Very durable and withstood being dropped. I was able to get it cheap with my cell phone company. Over time the memory became full but it was a good phone while I had it.
8877,"That was my first iPhone, i think it was great value, its small and girly, looks very neat, camera is great. Been using it for 2 years but then it started dying after 1hr of using, so had to switch to 6+"
8878,I used to have this phone but I upgraded to a 6s. It was great when I had it and is similar to all other iPhones. 
8879,my honest opinion i have always had a thing for the 4s and the 5s. I've alwasys wanted to save my money to get one since my parents couldnt get it for me. so far its been years and i still haven't made my dream come true of having one :( i really need to get one but its a good product from what i've heard
8880,"Kind of outdated, barely supports apps anymore.   starts to break down easy"
8881,Big screen and face paced. The white gets dirty fast so I would by an extra case for it. Also the screen cracks very easily. Very reliable and east to use. It does meet my expectations.
8882,When I happened to own this phone I LOVED IT! I have been with the apple company for a long time now I don't think I will ever go back! This is a must product 
8883,This phone was wonderful 2 years ago but now with all the newer versions and updates the phone can't keep up with it all. It tends to freeze up a lot. The good thing is about this phone is that the screen doesn't crack easily.
8884,"Very slow, unable to download certain apps because of the software, I would definitely recommend getting a newer model such as the 5s or 6"
8885,I really liked this phone when I had it but now I have the iPhone 5c witch is just as good as the iPhone  4 
8886,"Obviously, it was awesome before the 5s and 6s iPhones came out. Easy to use, smaller than the new phones and great interface."
8887,There's only two things I don't like about  this phone one is the camera quality the other is the undeleteable docked apps. 
8888,"Purchased second Hand, after 4 yrs of being on the market still one of the best smart phone I could hope to buy.   "
8889,"I had this phone for about two years and it was great i loved it so much. i hated the design, the two glasses made me really scared of drooping it and cracking in. but overalll i loved this phone"
8890,Good phone for about two years. It definitely lasts for the duration of a two year contract but not so much after that. Storage is definitely a little bit of an issue.
8891,One of my favorite phones. I'm always in love with apple products and i purchased this product a little over a year ago. Its super easy to use and carry.
8892,My iPhone 4S lasted me so long. Always kept up with the updates. iMessage always worked. 
8893,I absolutely love my Apple iphone 4s although now it is a little dated it has lasted me a good 4 years! To me that is a very long time for a touch screen device to last! I recently did finally crack my screen. So I am finally going to update to a newer iphone
8894,The battery kept dieing quickly. Was so frustrated with constantly charging and not having it all day to use. 
8895,"Had this phone for a few years, phone worked great and gave me no problems. I have been an apple supporter from the start and have only stuck to iPhones "
8896,This phone was bought for my daughter. Primarily because she uses an iPad so it was easier for her to transition to.
8897,I love iPhone. Seriously wouldn't have any other phone. They are simply the best!
8898,Great for chat  gaming and apps put breaks to easy and cost a lot to fix would not buy again 
8899,I love i phones but this phone is  really old and slow it also doesn't support many things so thats a down side
8900,"I love this phone, no its not the newest and its not an iPhone six but it does the job on a daily..."
8901,Best phone ever and the best carrier would not go back to a galaxy ever... ATT is wonderful 
8902,The iPhone 4s was my first iPhone and I used it for almost 3 years. It is a very good phone. 
8903,"While it was contemporary, it was a great phone. I wish that the newer iPhones were smaller like this one but its fine"
8904,This was my first Apple purchase and fell in love. This was a very easy to learn device.  I've since upgraded twice.  
8905,Love this phone!! Apple products are so great. I could never own anything other!
8906,"Apple is the best mobile phone company out there. Do not let anyone else fool you, most innovative and most reliable phone to date!"
8907,"This was my phone for several years, I just recently upgraded but it wasn't necessary, my 4s is still going strong. "
8908,"The 4S was my first IPhone, I must admit I was not sure what to expect as I've heard both good and bad things about the IPhone. I do love the ios operating system, however I do feel that its a bit restricted. Comparing it to the droid system my experience is that the droid has different  features which are a bit more user friendly.  "
8909,"Apple never fails me! I have had an iPhone since they were released and they have all the features, upgrades and ease of use. Love my iPhone!"
8910,"I loved my iPhone 4s. My battery was messing up and we don't have an Apple Store near the town I live in to send it off. The cell service company is also very small and only in my state so they're not a good place to have service with. I wanted a bigger one, storage wise because I knew I would fill it up fast and I did. My only complaint was I needed more storage other than the 16GB. I wish I was still using it instead of the 6s but they like to phase out technology very year!!!!"
8911,Love thiis phone it is an awesome phine to have very good pizza amd i like the thinner crust they offer
8912,This was my phone before i upgraded to the 6. It was definitely worth having but i would much prefer an upgraded iPhone as there are things you can do that the 4s can't.
8913,"Great phone. Apple never seems to disappoint! I also really like the size, not too big or small, also can take a beating!"
8914,"When it first came out it was an excellent phone, of the right dimensions and excellent capacities. Of course, it can't now keep up with the constant updates of the iOS. Surely, 16GB are not enough memory"
8915,I am happy with my iphone and i love all the things i can do with it. Especially because I can upload all of my music on the device.
8916,This phone is great but it is definitely not as great as some people f the newest iPhones that Apple has come out with 
8917,"Love it I have sworn by apple products I will never choose any other company for a phone and the only thing is if you drop it ,it shatters easily"
8918,I still have this phone now I am looking to get the 6s in black but at the moment I'm happy with the 4s. Probably my favorite phone I've had so far.
8919,"Really tired of the constant upgrades on these phones. I'll be switching to Samsung soon. Buh bye, apple! "
8920,"Very good, solid, dependable product. Camera is not as high quality as the newer iPhone models but it will get the job done! These phones last for incredibly long too"
8921,I had this phone for two years and towards the end of my two year contract it was complete hell!! It was sooo slow and NOTHING loaded. 
8922,Great phone. Holds a charge fairly well even with constant use. Extremely user friendly as compared to a Samsung Galaxy that I have previously owned. I love apple products!
8923,"This iPhone is not the best that the company has produced. The battery runs out very quickly, the software does not allow for recent updates and the camera quality is poor. "
8924,I love this phone . You could do so many things with it and take great pics ...it's a nice design phone and easy to take  every where 
8925,Really enjoy this phone. Battery quality is good. Love aññ the apps I get with it. Has lasted a long time with it
8926,"Very good phone. This was my first phone and i found it to be a great one. Now this phone is becoming outdated and I have since then upgraded, but you can still get this at a very reasonable price. would recommend as a good first phone for a younger child"
8927,"Love the phone, but hate how Apple doesn't allow for expandable storage. Definitely something I will consider in the future because app's are getting bigger and it stinks that the phone can't. "
8928,I mainly use this phone as an iPod. I love it. I have had this phone for a couple of years and its great.
8929,I like the new iphones better then this. apple has this thing of using the phone for a year or two and it gets sloweer
8930,I cannot stress how easy and reliable an iPhone is. It is amazing. I won't change it for anything
8931,Love iPhones even though I do have some trouble with them there still my favorite smart phone. 
8932,I love Apple products and they never disappoint!  Everything syncs up nicely and this was just another great product from Apple! 
8933,Great phone but pretty small and need to purchase lots of stuff but other then that it has ok quality 
8934,"Good for the entry level iPhones. Now we are at a 6, so this is a bit out of date with the apple world."
8935,It was a good phone when it came out but with technology advances the 5s and up are preferred.
8936,Best phone I ever had. the size is perfect. After this model Apple went to big with the size and screen but this phone was my favorite. I have a 6 now but miss this phone size. 
8937,"I loved my Apple iPhone 4S, but the only downfall was when the screen would black out and take me back to the home screen when I was in the middle of something. Especially when I was uploading pictures to FACEBOOK, it use to make me want to throw the phone (never did though lol)"
8938,Great phone lasted me a long time. You can never go wrong with Apple. Always good and dependent 
8939,I'm never giving up my iPhone! I love love love it! Android has forever lost a customer in me!
8940,Really love the iphone!. But would really love to upgrade it for an IPhone5s. would be so much better!!!!!
8941,"This smartphone, bought for photos, videos ... The picture is excellent. I personally really like the Apple. But I am willing to exchange my other hand. Maybe the iPhone 6. "
8942,I love my apple iphone 4s 16 GB smartphone. I recommend this cellphone to  everybody.  I love to play game an take pictures.
8943,The first iPhone I ever purchased was the iPhone 4s.  From then on I fell in love with the iPhone.  I had that phone for 3 years without any problems!  I am an apple lover for life after purchasing that phone. 
8944,Yes I'm still on the 4 but I must say I love apple! I don't have to import and export contacts like you do with other phone companies. Love that I cloud stores everything in case I lose phone or it gets damaged
8945,"This was my favorite phone I ever had. It was my first actual smartphone, and lasted through pretty much everything. I'm not super coordinated, so this phone got dropped quite a few times and the screen never cracked & I never had any issues. Great sound quality, screen was good, and there weren't all those unnecessary apps taking up space (I didn't upgrade to iOS 7). By the time I was eligible for a new phone they no longer sold the 4S, so I had to get the 5S, which I've had significantly more problems with. The 4S stayed charged much longer & charged faster, from my experience. Would definitely get this phone again. "
8946,Does the job but lately it lags so bad and freeze so a lot  my lock / power button is broken. Dire need of upgrade. 
8947,Good  iphone always good and use is also good love the touch schrrn and battery life so long then others.. 
8948,Love my phone! It was dropped in the water 3 times and it still works great!  I love how it takes amazing quality pictures and video! 
8949,"I've upgraded but I still use this phone as my  iPod, as well as an emergency phone. I can still play games on it, watch movies and stream while on wifi. It's a very good thing and I am glad I didn't recycle it. "
8950,Love the phone and my favorite feature is FaceTime. I use it all the time and love it! 
8951,I love my iPhone. I would never buy another brand of phone again. I'm pretty technologically challenged and this phone is fool proof! 
8952,"It was a good phone for the short time I had it.  I'm an Apple fan, so anything Apple is good for me. "
8953,This was my first ever iPhone and my only issue was the back cracked when I dropped it but on the contrary this is an amazing phone
8954,I had this phone for over two years and it never disappointed!  I finally upgraded to a 6S but I do miss my old phone!
8955,"Siri was a vast improvement on the 4, but Apple still leaves a lot to the imagination. Jailbreaking the phone is illegal but what else can one do if you want to customize ANYTHING? Apple is otherwise very user friendly, but not user customizable."
8956,This phone will not quit! I was happy to buy a new one once I finally retired my 4s to be my spare.
8957,This phone was my very first iPhone and I loved it! I will always own an apple phone after this 
8958,I love my iphone. I used to have an android but now i wouldn't go back from my iphone 
8959,"The storage is great and the white iPhone is just beautiful. The quality of the camera isn't the best, but if shopping for younger siblings or kids, this is the way to go!"
8960,"Great phone. Love the features and that it's made of glass, just wish it was bigger and came in more colors. "
8961,My first iPhone! I've upgraded but this one will always be my favorite iPhone. Easy to use and a great size. 
8962,This phone is pretty old in the apple line but it still works fine. The small screen can be an issue for some but it makes it easy to fit in your back jean pockets.
8963,It is the best phone i ever got. i really like the touch screen and love the use ablitly of the phone.
8964,"Easy to use and lightweight, Apple phones are great! Tonnes of apps are available, and some really fun cases. Reliable! "
8965,So great i love it so much. It has so much color and i enjoy using  it all the time. I got my sister one too.
8966,"I got this phone for my daughter as she is crazy about music, and all of her music is stored on iTunes. She loves the easy access to it all with this phone. The phone speed seems good as well, and she's able to access her favorite apps with no problems. "
8967,I had this phone a long time ago and I loved it but I have A 6 now and I can tell you the screen on the 4s is tiny 
8968,"I used android before I bought my iPhone and I will NEVER go back to android. I never put this phone down, and whether that's good or not, I LOVE MY IPHONE"
8969,"Honestly, ever since owning an iPhone, I can't see myself owning another brand of phone. As a new mommy I need something I can take photos & videos on and share them on all my social media sites! "
8970,Amazing phone love it. Would reccoment to anyone who is new to apple as it's a good beginers phone
8971,"I use this phone, i love it, everyone i know use it too...is really easy to use, and a nice looking =)"
8972,I still have this phone. Love it. Wanting the iPhone 6s. Just too expensive for me at the moment. But love iPhone. Will always be an apple head.
8973,I love my iphone. I can do verything from my phone without a problem. The only thing I wish it had was more storage space. 
8974,It was pretty good but the size is a little too small compared to the phones nowadays. But it still works like a regular Apple phone so whatever.
8975,Great phone it has lasted me two years until I dropped my phone out my blazer pocket and it broke because it hit a car never had a phone/iPhone better . R.I.P iPhone 4s
8976,This is my current phone right now...not at all impressed with the iPhone. I am an android girl. This is my first iPhone and I have to say I really miss my android phone! Hate the App Store on this stupid phone!
8977,"Work great, I love apple products..I also like the security features and the find iPhone feature"
8978,Good phone until the screen broke on the inside for no reason. Don't like that it doesn't have expandable memory. 
8979,I like it but I love the others better since they have improved over the years. This is still a very good phone.
8980,"This was my first Apple phone & I loved it!! My daughter now uses it to play on her apps, and it still works like a charm!!"
8981,I love my iPhone I wouldn't trade it for anything well maybe iPhone 6 lol but its easy to use and understand
8982,"The iPhone 4s filled up on storage quickly. It also would die really early regardless of what your phone says (it would die at 30-40%). The iPhone is great with other apple products but due to it being old now, you may run into some issues."
8983,"Heavy, like carrying a thin brick. The screen blacks out a lot and has to be restarted"
8984,This was my second iPhone and it was easy to use and compact with a great camera before newer models came out!
8985,I love this phone i been having for a long time and so far its a good food. it woks fast and it takes good pics which i love 
8986,Not at all happy with this. I have had a ton of software issues and the camera isn't great.
8987,This is the second time I have owned this exact phone. It serves it's purpose and I have no problems with it. With all of the larger phones on the market now I would prefer to have a bigger screen
8988,"Apple 4S-16GB is a great handheld device. Simple for beginners yet with limitless amount of apps for the more tech savvy! Keeps charged all day with normal use, doesn't freeze or stop responding. "
8989,It's boxy. It's sturdy. The speakers work well. But after you start to collect apps and pics... The phone slows down
8990,"I love my iPhone, It was easy to use and lightweight. And there is always a case for it. everywhere."
8991,"I have had my iphone 4 forever before upgrading to the iphone 5s! Great phone, reliable, easy to use!"
8992,It's a good phone I just hate the fact that it's a lot of glass so if you drop it the odds r it's gonna break other wise pretty good phone
8993,"IPhone 4s is cool , it gets all the new emojis & all that. it was real good when I had it"
8994,The iPhone 4s is a good phone but sprint has horrible service where I'm located. even putting it on another carrier doesn't work. always out of range . 
8995,I had this phone for almost a year. I upgraded almost a year ago and I'm kinda happy that u got a bigger screen because I was so use to a small screen on this phone. I would not go back to this phone but it's a great phone for someone who likes smaller phone!
8996,Don't really like apple. Since it's made out of all glass it cracked on me very easily 
8997,"Loved this phone while I had it. I kept it until the 6 and 6 Plus came out, and didn't have any issues. I wished I had more memory because I filled it up with pictures, thanks to the great camera!"
8998,This apple iPhone has been great  has never given me any problems  have used this iPhone for years with no trouble at all
8999,"Love my iPhone, be lost if I changed to any other kind. Have looked but always stay. "
9000,A good phone while it lasted but eventually the battery began giving me problems. Went to an Iphone 6S Plus now! :)
9001,I found this phone has high quality and now dirt cheap a great choice for young teens like me i have had this for quite some time now and has never disappointed me 
9002,The 4S was a great addition to the iPhone family. I loved the size and weight and the performance was really great too. I saw the biggest improvement with the photo quality. 
9003,"I love this phone, tons of cute cases as well as functions. Its great at my job, and for personal use. my only issue to date is that the power cords break easily "
9004,"I loved mu iphone... Love my 5c too.  They are easy learn how to use them.  I must admit though, you are either apple or droid, there is nothing in between"
9005,I must be  honest it is cool but it's hard to use and there aren't a lot of apps for it and it have a bad bluetooth the doesn't work with other phones and theirs a lot more but otherway it's great
9006,"I have this iPhone for four years and now it's so hard for me to use it, it turns off when the battery is at 50% and only turns back on when it reaches 100%.I can't use it anymore, I desperately need a new iPhone!"
9007,"This Phone its amazing, i use ir for a long time and works perfectly, its fast and the camara its ok."
9008,It's an iPhone so of course it's a great product! When I had this phone I enjoyed it very much! 
9009,"It does the job. I mean it is no Iphone 6, but I am not paying for it my mum is, so I guess I cannot complain."
9010,"I love getting the ""s"" versions so they can get all the bugs sorted out. This is this first version they had passbook and really could utilize Netflix and video streaming apps. "
9011,"I loved my iPhone! It was simple and  easy to you.  The camera was decent but I do realize now that there are better out there! On occasion the phone would freeze and have to be restarted, but the same goes for Androids  "
9012,My husband and i both have apple iphones and we just love them i don't think i could use anohter phone after having htis one
9013,"This was my very first phone and it lasted pretty good but then the camera started breaking. But keep in mind, the phone was in use for 4 years at that point"
9014,I'm a big fan of apple products. This phone works great and I like that it is still a smaller size. 
9015,This iPhone is so slow. I hate using it after I had an iPhone 5C. It's a lot bulkier too.
9016,Apple is the best cell phone around . I have had two and I can say that I will never go back to android.everything just looks great and it doesn't feel cheap and very affordable with cell phone companies
9017,"The iPhone 4s is a gorgeous phone, from its glass front, the metal band outlining it, to the glass back"
9018,I loved this phone when I had it. Pretty much every apple product is amazing and definitely recommend it.
9019,"I am a big fan of almost all apple products! I had this phone before I upgraded to the 6. It worked wonderfully and was very easy to use. Only complaint is that it will slow down with time and less storage space. It still works, but does seem to be a bit slower when in use."
9020,Had this phone way back I loved it. It was easy to handle and use. Only wish it wouldve been bigger
9021,Love my iphone 4s even after not having service I still use it as just an iPod its the best love love love!!
9022,"Loved it when i had it, until the last six months. It got some weird virus that made it darn near impossible to use. ugh!"
9023,"All the apps are made for bigger iphone screens now & my iphone is really beat up, so i would like an upgrade"
9024,I love apple products. I have had 3 iPhones and I get so attached to them. They are great phones and don't lag. 
9025,I have this iphone but through verizon and its pretty good so far no complaints just waiting for my upgrade to get the 6
9026,"It's a good phone but if you are willing to spend a little bit more money, you should buy a more recent one: they have much more quality and new functions that are really helpful! I have a 4S for 2 years now and it's starting to give me some problems! "
9027,I have had the Apple iPhone since the very beginning. Tried going to the Samsung galaxy and hated it! Will never use anything other than an iPhone. Hands down my favorite!!
9028,"Bought this phone as a starter phone for my teenage son. It's low price point, particularly purchased refurbished, meant we could make the investment without the commitment. "
9029,"Same trusty phone and all the apps that I'm familiar with plus bigger, better screen.  It also has much more memory than my previous phone which means I can take a lot more pictures and videos of my kids and dog!  "
9030,"The 4s was a perfect phone for me until the ios 8 update came out and the 4s could not be updated. I was super disappointed that I could no longer use apps I previously had, such as Infuenster, Snapchat and other shopping apps. I felt this was Apples way of making people upgrade to the 5 or above. We still have 4s, we just use them as ""ipods"" for our children now. Both my husband and I both went to Samsung and Android to avoid forced system updates, and also to have more storage without having to pay to store to the cloud."
9031,I love Apple! Pictures come out great. Never really had issues with the iPhone's. 
9032,I love my apple I phone. There is so many thing you can do on it and Apple is a great brand for anyone.
9033,Apple products will always be my favorite. I purchased the 4S for my mom a few months back and she loves it. It's so easy for her to use 
9034,"My favorite forever, this doesn't have a finger detector But I still love it, is small"
9035,Anything that has to do with Apple is just simply great ! I love all Apple products and I've never had a complaint about it
9036,"Currently have the iPhone 6 but the 4 is my favorite, still have it brand new "
9037,I had this phone for 3 years. It never cracked and worked great until I just recently traded it in. 
9038,My right hand. I couldn't work without this brilliant machine. The technology makes it easy to be connected when I need to be. 
9039,"I love apple products. This phone worked like a champ. The only reason I upgraded was because the screen broke. But besides that, I had zero problems with it."
9040,"When the 4S was popular, I had many of these through out. I bought like 3 or 4 and gave them as gifts also I did a buy and sell with this phone. Amazing phone but the screen is a little small compared to all the rest. But it's light weight and perfect Apple technology "
9041,"Until the newer models came out, I loved my 4S. I'm one of those people who waits to buy the newer iPhones so they have time to work the kinks out. Love Apple and iOS. Also, I didn't start having any issues with my 4S until right around when the 6 came out, so it outlasted an entire generation, which I think is pretty impressive."
9042,"Great phone, but unfortunately it's pretty outdated now. Mine lasted me three years and held up great! The phone is quite durable and survived many severe drops w/o shattering. I also prefer the size and shape of this one as opposed to the 6s."
9043,"It's a great phone, everyone I know has one, it's user friendly and works great for me. It's like a mini computer "
9044,I bought this phone in 2010 and it lasted me until this year. 6 years is a long time for a smartphone. I dropped it on so many hard surfaces and there wasn't a crack. I only gave it up because the battery started dying within an hour and then I upgraded to a 6s+. I couldn't be happier.
9045,Its an okay phone but its pretty outdated i have a lot of problems with it freezing and having to restart it 
9046,"Love this phone!! This does everything!! Who needs a computer with this thing! Once you get an Apple phone, you don't go back. It just works. Period."
9047,I love my 4S and don't want to upgrade to any other iPhone! I find it's the perfect size! 
9048,"Used to have this phone and loved it. The only problem with apple products is that they tend to slowly stop working as newer products come out. I love iphones, though. "
9049,"Me gusta bastante, es rapido y tiene muy buena resolucion aunque su ultimo software es muy pesado para el tlfno, se apaga antes delo debido"
9050,"I am very disappointed with the iPhone's. I have had nothing but problems, from the phone shutting off by itself to various different battery problems. I have also had problems with charging and chargers. I would stay clear of iPhones all together."
9051,Great phone great camera and applications compatible with any iPhone product  fullfill  my xpectations.
9052,I have been a fan of Apple Iphones since they first came out. It is super simple to use. Very good camera quality. 
9053,"My poor iPhone 4S has been well used! It has been dropped, kicked, thrown and still works. My only complaint is battery life but then again I do have a ton of apps on my phone!
"
9054,"I just love the Apple Store 
My first phone was a iPhone and till this point I own a iPhone I just love everything about it"
9055,I love apple products. The I phone 4s is pretty outdated buy now but I still currently have one (however I will be buying the 6s in a month) It ran well at first but after about a year it became very glitchy and slow. 
9056,I use an iPhone 4s for work. The battery life is good and the functionality works well. I notice with all the recent iOS updates the application seem to lag more or begin o have issues after each one.
9057,This was my first smartphone and I loved it!!! They do shatter if dropped so beware. That's how mine met its demise.  But the good thing about Apple is there is always something new in the works. And yes you have to have it.
9058,"I just love the  Apple Store 
My first phone was a iPhone and till this point I own a iPhone I just love everything about it "
9059,Very good phone cracks easy but I mean what phone doesn't. This phone is basically outdated now a days 
9060,"This phones camera is absolutely amazing. When you compare it to something like the HTC Evo, you won't be disappointed with this."
9061,I will literally never use another phone again. Apple has gotten me locked in with the iPhone just like they do with all their other products. So user friendly and such a beautiful design. Love this phone. Don't know how I ever had another one.
9062,"I recommend this to parents for their child because it has space and memory  for school and home.
"
9063,Best phone ever! After a day of using i picked up straight on how to use it! Everthing you pay for this phone is totally worth it!
9064,"My iPhone 4s was just two years old and the battery got to be ridiculous, i would have it in my bag at 100 percent and four hours later without being used it would be at 10 percent"
9065,This phone is such an amazing device which gives me no problems when using it. It is a neat looking device which does not look bad on the eye and it is the perfect size.
9066,Its great but I'm really ready for an iphone 6 with more space. it keeps telling me my storage is full but i don't really have that much on it. something with a nicer camera would also be good
9067,Amazing I got this at the start of 2015 second hand but it's still great. The prices are reasonable as they are a brilliant phone. Well worth the money 
9068,This phone is very old and is most likely not super relevant anymore. It was a good phone when I had it but I have since upgraded since.
9069,Loved this phone for 4 yrs. pretty good phone life until the battery overheated and I had to get a new phone. Hope my new one lasts as long
9070,"I really have no issues with this phone, I know it is old now but I like it because I find it more durable than the new editions, I have dropped it hundreds of times and not one crack. However, I am thinking of getting an upgrade soon, just because mine is starting to get a little slow, and sometimes freezes. "
9071,"Love it! Easy to use, but I highly suggest buying a good case for this phone if you're a butter fingers like me. It's saved my phone more than once! "
9072,Its a awesome phone!! it may not be the latest and the greatest but at a time it was ALL THE RAGE its a great phone it can do evrey thing a phone should do plus more!
9073,"Though this model is not new it is very handy and inexpensive. The IPhone 4s comes with the ability to download most if not all apps that any other IPhone can. The camera quality is very good but the front camera isn't always great.
"
9074,"I love the iPhone, but do miss my android. I miss the large screen size and the accessibility."
9075,This is the phone that I am currently using.  It was top of the line when it came out.  Now there are faster phones with more memory.  
9076,"I loved my 4s. I would have kept it a long time if I hadn't dropped it in the toilet. Sigh. 
But obviously, with Appke products, newest is best. I can't say I would buy a 4s now that I've had a 5s and a 6s. The technology is obsolete."
9077,"There are no words needed, apple has the best products that combine technology and design"
9078,"Phone is fine. Very user friendly. However, phone shuts off at random times-typically in the middle of the night when I need my alarm. I always set a backup. 😐"
9079,I love all Apple products. I don't think I could survive without my Apple iPhone. I tried another brand of  phone and I was lost. 
9080,Apple products are my favorite because they're so see explanatory and easy to use. Ever saw the vines of kids 5 and under playing on an iPhone like they own it? Yeah. Because it's so asf explanatory a kid can use it. So that's why it's my favorite. 
9081,"I loved this phone when it came out. I used it for a year until I dropped it and shattered the glass on both sides, which is he reason for the four stars. I traded it in for the 5 when it came out. I'll never go back to the Samsung line of phones and all the problems I had with them. "
9082,"I love iPhone, don't get me wrong but it's stupid you have to upgrade every time a new update comes out. "
9083,I loved this phone up until I cracked it (not bad) after It cracked it froze up all the time but It did have great camera quality . Apple is great but get a 5s or 6 Ive had both and didn't have a problem with them
9084,"I used my 4s for 2 years! It worked great, I loved it and it lasted so great and it was super durable!"
9085,I love my phone it works so well and has a decent amount of storage space. The only down side is that it is really slow.
9086,"I have the Apple iPhone 4s 34gig and I HATE it!! I hate that you have to take it to someone to have anything fixed on it, it sucks at charging, the battery dies so fast and it's got so many bugs it sucks! Never again will I ever own another IPhone, I'm going back to android "
9087,"This iPhone is by far my favorite phone. Sleek, clean, updates well, plenty of storage, and amazing photos!"
9088,"I used to own that phone it was very good. Just upgraded for  new Iphone. I love iphones, good quality"
9089,"Apple phones are always the best. I trust all Apple products. Two thumbs up. Everything we have is integrated and works so well together. (iPhone, Mac book, Apple TV, etc) "
9090,Very poorly made phone however the current price is extremely cheap but I recommend buying a different phone.
9091,Extremely well compact very easy to use ! It is no longer being updated by Apple incorporation. 
9092,Love my iphone. the camera is great an has done well by me over the past few years. i am ready to upgrade
9093,I like the Apple software/programs but after 5 years using the same products the only thing that felt NEW was the size of the product....same format throughout all devices makes for ease of use but also a bit boring!
9094,"It did its job for the most part. I dropped mine in the toilet and is worked pretty well for about another 6 months with the occasionally shut down and glitch 
"
9095,"Well it is a good iPhone for its time, but now the amount of space on it is just too small, the size and screen too small, and also the its charging and docking port is fast becoming obsolete."
9096,My current phone...it has been consistent and love the size...freezes up every once in a while but overall have been happy with it
9097,"I had this phone a while ago and I loved it at the time, but since updating I would never go back. It worked but cracked easy. That is why I prefer the 5c."
9098,"This is a solid addition to the iPhone family.  It's now probably a little outdated with the software updates, but it was a great phone for the year that I've been using it. "
9099,I loved my IPhone 4s white in color.  I did not have any issues with it for the 2 years I owned it. 7months or so ago I up graded to iPhone 6. I gave my old phone to my mom and she is still using it. I am very happy with apple products. They are easy to use and a lot of great apps to download. 
9100,"I screen it's broke and one shut 
My smartphone Alcatel drop out many and don't broke
Very expensive and delicated"
9101,My phone was great at first and then had so many issues. It froze up all the time
9102,I'm a big apple fan.  I love my iphone.  Going to upgrade to a 6S someday but for now this one is good.
9103,I LOVE my 4s!! after sending in my 6 several times for my screen not being responsive. I had to downgrade to my 4s meanwhile is was getting fixed! I talked down on my tiny rock of a phone but its what kept me alive! LOL 
9104,I have previously only bought Apple products but I am slowly making the move to Android.   Not happy with how quickly the Apple products become useless with new updates.    
9105,Really good camra anything but bad when water get near or on it lots of cases for this phone cracks easy
9106,I had my 4s for 3 years. It was an excellent phone and held up well despite how rough I am on technological devices. 
9107,Although this is old I love it. I would recommend getting a newer one if possible because you get all the new updates and you can download all apps but for a clumsy young person this is perfect!
9108,"It was my first iPhone (after this one I bought the 5s GOLD) and to be an used phone it worked really good for me, I had cheap access to pieces and stuff and I changed it because I wanted to, not because it got broke or anything"
9109,Kept this phone for 2 years and only got a new one because I had cracked it and it was time for my upgrade. Would've probably kept the phone longer if it had not been for that.
9110,It's a great phone ! Sometimes it can be a little slow and the picture qualities could be a little better but other than that I love the phone !
9111,"As I sit and write this, I am doing so on my iPhone. It truly is the computer I can take anywhere. I don't know how we as a society survived without them. The Razor days must have been tough, and I didn't even know it at the time. "
9112,"Amazing phone! Fluid Ui, Amazing screen, The Apps are dazzling and the Ecosystem is the Killerest part. iCloud is a Bliss and the Camera is Top Notch. "
9113,Good phone. Would recommend the newer phones because they are bigger and easier to use. 
9114,This was my very first iPhone I had it for four years and have never had problems with it it i had never had to get it replaced or fixed it lasts a long time. The battery last a long time and can store a good amount of data. It might not be the newest version of the iPhone but still is a very good phone.
9115,I love iPhone 4S I love the size and weight of it because it's easy to hold that way. Ive dropped it many times and nothing has happened to it. I do wish it had more space and a better quality camera. 
9116,"I currently have this product the battery last a long time, the operating system is some what slow compared to the newer once. The one  I do not like is the cord it comes with it is not very durable and bends easily which caused it to no longer work. Picture quality is amazing but I would say I should have purchased one with more memory. It can not be used with the new apple watch with does have the latest update needed but can not be used along with it which is a bummer."
9117,I love my iPhone I've had it for years with the right case and have had no problems with it 
9118,"The Iphone is the only phone I've used for years.It is the most user friendly phone on the market in my opinion
"
9119,"Compare to iPhone 6s,  iPhone 4s is much more heavier but the camera is descent. It captures great pictures and it is apllicable to a lot of apps. It is much smaller than the latest one but for people that have small hands like myself is easier to type."
9120,It works as well as other phones do but occasionally it glitches due to the fact that it's old but it's still a great phone.
9121,I love my iPhone. I could not use anything else but this. Imessage is the best thing since sliced bread.
9122,"First iphone and my favorite, until it started running slowly because of all the upsdates "
9123,"I used to be a Blackberry gal.  The Apple 4S iPhone was my introduction into the apple world.  I must say, I am hooked.  We are now a family of multi Apple iPhone products, and the 4s has gone through many owners and is still going strong.  This is a very user friendly phone.  "
9124,I've always been a Apple user and nothing that is an Apple product will disappoint me. My household only have apple products.
9125,Loved my iPhone 4 when I had it but I have recently upgraded. It was reliable and I'm glad that it still had the most recent iOS. Bit of a pain though if I forgot my charger because my friends all had newer iPhones so I couldn't borrow a charger.
9126,"Had it before ,great cell phone to star with! Very slow and doesn't take great picture but its fine"
9127,"This is a good iPhone but due to the newer versions of iPhones, it is slower and has less features than its successors. "
9128,"Not a bad phone, but I wish it was easier to add attachments to emails.  Same with contacts.  Wish I could just sent a contacts info to someone else without having to go into my contacts.  Also wish I could add multiple contacts and multiple attachments.  Blackberry was great for business type work, shame iPhone can't seem to make its phones more business friendly."
9129,"I prefer the black/space grey version, but pretty good phone easy to use. expensive though"
9130,I love apple products. The I phone 4s is pretty outdated buy now but I still currently have one (however I will be buying the 6s in a month) It ran well at first but after about a year it became very glitchy and slow. Some apps would crash randomly and the power on/off button broke and was very hard to press. Also the glass back can crack if the phone is dropped but luckily has since been replaced by a metal back in newer iPhones. The camera quality is alright but is very grainy if the lighting is bad. The 4s was good during its time but by now it is very outdated.
9131,Love apple and all their products. Its easy to use and convenient. Had  this phone for along time until i switched to the 6
9132,As always the iPhone doesn't disappoint. I just need to be more conscious of the software updates because of you don't keep up your phone will start acting up. Also have some battery issues
9133,Love my iphone. Ease of use is key to me. Iphones couldn't be  easier to get the hang of.
9134,"I use this every day, its very easy to use and handy! It serves the right purposes of a phone however, the camera quality could be improved."
9135,I personally didn't like my 4S phone. I now have the iPhone 6 and i love it. Apple products are very nice and they're improving everyday. 
9136,Great phone. good battery time. doesn't tend to crash as many other phones like it. the white color is very versatile. 
9137,"I have a pink Iphone 5c, I love it but can't wait to upgrade either. Seems these phones don't last from one upgrade to another."
9138,Love Apple iPhones I love not having to pack a phone a camera an iPod or a garmen with me on vacations it's all wrapped up into one
9139,"The first iPhone that I purchase and kept it for 3 years. I loved it and won't be going back to an Android anytime soon. The phone still works up to this day, my dad had it now and he loves it too. "
9140,This has lasted a long time. I love the convenience of the finger print unlock feature. Siri is always fun to mess around with and apple music has gotten me through two 15 hour car rides.
9141,This was my first iPhone and I loved it. I'm still an iPhone user today and these phones always live up to expectations.
9142,I love my  Iphone 6 it is smooth sophisicated hunky unky straight from the Apple store 
9143,I LOVE Apple products. They rarely mess up and are just great quality. I have my entire family hooked now. 
9144,"Reliable, user friendly, so simple my little kids can use it but sophisticated enough to keep up with all the daily demands of my life. I couldn't survive being a mother, a full time employee and active member of the community without this phone!"
9145,"Love my Iphone, i have been using Apple phones for the last 10 years and don't think I will ever change brands"
9146,Still up and running. works just like my current iPhone 6. i use this mostly as a extra iPod since i don't use it as a phone. 
9147,"Not too bad of a phone, memory ran out super fast and also battery was trash. Was afraid to drop it because of cracking, wouldn't buy again. "
9148,"Iphone 4s was a great phone several years ago, but it is now outdated technology.  Just get a 6 or 6+.  4s cannot do the newer iphone updates and are very slow compared to the newer phones"
9149,Works heavenly is a bit small and outdated but it works well love apple as well. I would like a better phone though
9150,"This phone has a surprisingly okay battery life! It's what you'd expect from an iphone, just put a good case on it if you don't want it shattered in a month."
9151,I'm in love with the Apple operating system. I think it's a great phone but it is time to buy something newer and obviously will be of Apple. NEVER has disappointed me
9152,My first iPhone and not going back to any other phone I don't like change so Apple updates will smoothly transition me into it so I won't change other than a newer iPhone like I have now just you have to buy a lifeproof case cuz so it's a must 
9153,"My iPhone 4s may not be as great as the 6, but I like it. It is small and can still fit in my pocket, while being able to do everything I want it to!"
9154,"Love this product, it defiantly gets the job done. It worth a try for the people that haven't used it. i love my phone"
9155,It worked for the 1st three month. Bout used. Then woke up one morning and it no longer worked. Company said there wasn't enough space to undo update. And it was garbage.
9156,"Good phone, small screen and memory runs out fast no more software updates, old not best to use anymore"
9157,"I'm already used to using Apple products, however
I still think that this product is relatively easy to use, 
and runs fairly quickly. The only problem is the fact that
the product can not be updated to the newest iOS, which
means that some features are not available and some
apps can not be downloaded...however
for the majority of apps, this isn't a problem as an older
version can be downloaded"
9158,"Loved the phone when i first got it, now I call it a icrap.  it is slow, always says no free space when there is hardley anything on it. cant take more than 40 pictures  it says no space cant wait for contract to be over to upgrade to a samsung"
9159,Good if this is your first iPhone. You can't get the new updates so that's a huge bummer.
9160,"I like the phone, I have had technical problems with it though which was a drag. But, customer service always takes care of me. "
9161,Yes it's a decent phone and not to mention it's an iPhone. The size of the screen is too small for me. I would hate to have a phone that small. Your better off buy and Android phone which is more economical. Or buying the 6
9162,"I love the iPhone4 because of all the apps you can get to organize your life and it's camera. Who knew that your life can be organized in the palm of your hands? I've been able to sell and buy off the eBay app. Purchase from Living Social, Groupon and Amazon. Price compare with RedLaser. Go on the internet to check email/search. I no longer have to carry my wallet/keys full of membership cards because I have an app that scanned all those numbers. I cannot live without my iPhone. The iPhone4 has now replaced my GPS, my calender book, my iPod, and point and shoot camera. My purse is now so much lighter."
9163,Who doesn't like apple products. I like the white color mostly because it looks better. I wish I would've bought the one with more memory so I could put more music on it.
9164,I love my phone and go no where without it. It has so many apps that I always have something to do and it captures pictures of the kids great! Thank you Apple for doing it again! 
9165,"Great phone for people of all ages, easy interface, simple setup, and great apps to help with setup. This phone shows great service in all areas and has plenty of storage space."
9166,"I had this phone with no problem for 3 years. It was literally ,my life. Unfortunately I was never able to update past ios7 dye to performance issues. "
9167,"I like a simple smartphone and a tablet to use while at home. And I love my iPhone, it does exactly what it needs to do. "
9168,This phone good but. You can not compare the iphone four with the iphone 5 or 6. Its a lot worse. I cant dowload someting and I'm not happy. But ... I cant buy the ihone 6 so I have the iphone 4.
9169,This is my trusty phone. I switched to Samsung Galaxy and love the Samsung. I wish the two phones could be combined to make a super smart phone. There are features on my galaxy that I love but can't use in my iPhone but Iphone also has features and apps (FaceTime and iMessage) that I can't used on Samsung. I want to upgrade to the 6s plus but j also will keep my Samsung phone.
9170,"I hate my iPhone 4s, I'm not trying to be ungrateful but it lags, doesn't connect to the wifi( Apple dosen't know how to fix it and won't give me a new phone), and the screen is so small!"
9171,"Love my phone but it is getting a bit old, wouldn't rccomend buying it anymore as it can't handle the newer updates and so the apps crash all the time and i can't use a lot of things with it."
9172,"The 4s is not good compared to the 6 or 5s, it is slow and has many problems but apple came through with the 6"
9173,I had this phone for over a year and a half my only complaint was that the screen broke extremely easy
9174,"Great starter phone but compared to the newer iPhones out today this phone is smaller, slower & has less storage"
9175,"This was my first phone. I got it back in 8th grade when it was cool, but apparently they're consign back, like a vintage type thing. I suggest getting one before here considered old so you can give it to your kid when it becomes cool again "
9176,"Fabulous phone. I would definitely recommend this to someone who is just starting out with smartphones. There are a few restrictions with apps, since it has older software. "
9177,I didn't have a problem with this phone except for the glass screen is easily broken but it has a good battery life. 
9178,Pretty good phone? still does what u need it to do however apple is attempting to phase it out so watch it for soon being too old
9179,"Love my  iPhone 6 , easy to use, love the features, but if I was a man would hate having to put in jeans pocket...."
9180,"I have had this phone for about four years (although not in continuous use.) Although it is not my current phone, I absolutely loved it!! My only complaint is the inability to update."
9181,I bought this phone used in May 2015 and so far I really like it! I can't wait to get the new one :-)
9182,I use to use this phone a while ago but i still use it as a music device. its still holding up and i have dropped it lots of times already and even wet it.
9183,I love my iPhone and I bought this one recently as an upgrade to my iPhone 4. I like the new features and the upgraded camera but overall I like the comfort level I have with Apple products in general.
9184,"I was against smart phones for a long time but when my ""dumb phone"" finally died I gave in because I got a great deal on this phone.  The only thing I would change is more memory but it is an older phone so I cannot complain too much.  It is great-amazing.  I don't know what I did before I got a smart phone-the world at my fingertips. I love it. "
9185,I am a true fan of iphones.  I no longer have the 4s due to upgrading to a newer version of the iphone
9186,This phone was great but once the newer versions came out the phone was not supported as well and my phone ended up with hlotcjes
9187,Well i hawe it still but it don't work for me it's too small and it crashes i really don't recommend buying it i would love hawe a new one but i cant
9188,I have been using the iPhone 4s for more than 3 years now and can't spot a single mistake. I have also purchased an iPhone 6 last year and love it too. My experience in using both the phones have been amazing. I love it so much that I can't live without my iphones. 
9189,"GREAT TO WATCH MOVIES, VIDEO CHAT, SEARCH WEB AND LIST GOES ON . MUST BUY.. YOU WILL LOVE  IT "
9190,"I bought it used for $100, got it unlocked and can use it with my carrier. This sucker had suffered so many falls but only has one crack on the back. It takes great pics and has lots of storage! The only thing I hate is the battery life smh"
9191,Awesome phone with fantastic features.it is really secure and got lot of good features compare to other phones.
9192,Compared to others this iPhone ran slow and had a lot of glitches. I had to get multiple parts replaced at the Apple Store. However Apple is universal and easy to use
9193,"Good phone with good camera... now that newer ios's are out, phone is lagging...but is fully functual.."
9194,"Had this phone for 2 years it worked great. Than this last year we had the new up date. It slowed down , so I changed to a 6s"
9195,This was my first iPhone and I can genuinely say my favorite phone I'll never go back to androids
9196,I love the iPhone. The 4 was my first and I upgrade every 2 years.  I tried the Samsung and hated it. 
9197,LOVE this phone.  It's easy to use and store.  It is very expensive though so I probably won't buy another iPhone after this one.
9198,It is not letting me pick the right iphone I have the 5s and I love it so far! It is easy to use and Siri is an added bonus. I would recommend this phone.
9199,Slow and not a great camera. Fine for basics but bogged down easily. It got worse when the newer ones came out.
9200,First time with an iphone. Easy to get used to it and I like the camera. It is lightweight and I like the style. 
9201,This was my first phone that I ever got and I really like it. I don't use my phone much other than to text and make the occasional phone call so this model worked well for me.
9202,Love this phone! Every single thing imaginable is right at your finger tips. I put a case on it and have never had to worry about it breaking no matter how many times I drop it!
9203,"I have one right now, and it's good. I wish Apple didn't have so many restrictions but what are you gonna do?"
9204,I had this phone for long time and used it into it crack into pieces and millions of pieces 
9205,Love my IPhone! But I have gone through so many of them. They break extremely easy even with a screen protector and case. They are also very prone to getting stolen since they are worth a lot. It has happened to me two or three times in public. This may just be me but I am sure it has happened to others.
9206,"Great phone, I have had little to no issues using this.  It was also my very first smart phone, very easy to use and set up."
9207,I loved this little phone. It did everything I needed it to and lasted me for 2 years!!
9208,"I like the phone cause it's small and durable, dropped it quite a few times and has not broken on me yet, which I'm quite surprised by it. And till this day I have not broken and still using it. "
9209,This phone has been super reliable from the start. I am happy it has lasted me so long. 
9210,This product was my first iPhone. And I love it. I still have it. It works great and is a perfect size for me. Great product!
9211,"This phone is a TOUGH. COOKIE. I drop it at work coooonstantly and it has yet to quit working. There are actual physical holes in my phone, but it still works."
9212,The camera and function of the phone was cool for the most part. The app store did stop crafting apps to fit the device and that's because not all updates worked for the device.
9213,I had this phone for almost two years and really enjoyed it! It lasted long and I got all the perks of being a part of Apple. Their iOS system really is the best and I could never imagine switching!! I also feel like this is the perfect size of any of the iPhone's released!
9214,"Was nice as my first phone, small enough for my tiny hands to hold. Siri on it was helpful. "
9215,Very good for young ones to start with a new phone and that are new to the technology of the world! 
9216,"I recently purchased this as a gift for my husband for Christmas and he loves it, a lot better than the older version!"
9217,"At the time I loved it, it was wonderful. Now compared to my current phone it's so little! "
9218,I own one myself and I love it if a lifelong friend you cannot go without you can watch all your movies and surreal fares to your messages going twitter facebook Instagram you know that you are sure
9219,Este es mi smarphone es muy bueno y rapido procesador me encanta hadta los momentos todo bien
9220,This is a great cellphone. Works really good. The only problem is the low space to save your photos and videos.
9221,"Love Apple iPhones. Use it for everything! Love that it connects into my cat phone, has Internet, and many easy to download apps. Just wish it had more room."
9222,"This phone was really good for a long time, but by the time the 6 came out, I started having LOTS of problems. I wouldn't buy a phone this old now."
9223,"This phone is actually a really OK purchase. Even if    it´s not the tastes of the apple phones, it has a better camera than iPhone 4, so over all a good purchase :)"
9224,"It was an okay phone,it did its job but now that there are more iPhone it's a pretty basic phone "
9225,"I have had to take this phone back many times. if its not one thing, its another. tired of iphone. they aren't made to last"
9226,Best investment ever. I love my iPhone. I don't think I will be going back to anything else. 
9227,Wish it had more memory space. But all in  all it is a pretty good phone and I love it.
9228,"I got this phone when it first came out, and I still have it till this day. It's pretty good, but keeps telling me to update, whenever I update the phone it becomes slower 😓 but aside from that it's still a pretty decent phone "
9229,I love my iPhone 4s. It was so easy to use.  Great camera. Very user friendly.
9230,"I have always loved my iPhones, it is really all I've ever used. But I feel like they're becoming slower and not as good of a device as they used to be. "
9231,"This was my first smartphone, so I loved it from the start. It was very user friendly and quick to learn. It helps that so many people use Apple products and can help with any questions. Also, customer service is simply the best out there. Love my iPhone!"
9232,"It operates decently, but it is so outdated with many apps. This device is so fragile you must have a case "
9233,Love this phone. It's the gold IPhone 4s. I feel like it will never fail me. Some of the newer phones I see seem to have a ton of problems. 
9234,"Love this phone! I have been able to use it as a Camara, computer, phone, alarm, calculator and the list goes on. I've had this until I upgraded to an Apple iPhone 5s. Apple all the way for me and my family. Can't go wrong with Apple iPhones."
9235,This was my first iPhone I ever had and it was by far my favorite. I loved the size and the shape. The newer versions seem a bit more flimsy and cheap. I loved my iPhone 5c and do love my 6s but none compare to the good old iPhone 4 
9236,"This is my second iPhone. I left and went to a Samsung in between and boy, was that a poor decision. The iPhone is durable, reliable and easy to use. I will never make that mistake again. "
9237,"This was my first iphone. While I did love it, I was so glad to upgrade! This iphone is wonderful, just slightly out of date with the current ios. "
9238,Used to have it I have a 5C now through T-Mobile and I wish I could go back to my 4S through Straighttalk. It was a lot more durable I wish it could do the new updates!
9239,I have been using an iPhone since 2008 and am a loyal customer of them.  My whole family has iPhones.
9240,I had this phone for three years and loved it. It just got to the point where I did not have enough space and it became extremely slow. 
9241,"This phone is great, only problem was slight glitches and issues with battery life, but definitely a great prices and quality phone to have."
9242,"I have had the 3G,4S,5s and currently the 6s. These iPhone have changed my life. They help me stay organized. I like having the option to watch YouTube and answers emails at the same time. This is a perfect smartphone for a beginner (4s). This is the model I got my brother. My son is using it now as his starter iPhone. The battery life is great too. "
9243,"This was the first iPhone I ever had and it was great, it seems so small compared to my current one but it was good phone. It had Siri so that was useful but after two years it began to freeze a lot and have many issues "
9244,"It's old but I like my phone. It works, I can make calls, I can send texts and access 4g "
9245,"I had this phone for more then 2 years and my parents all had it more then 3 and this is probably the biggest work horse of a phone out of all the phones, even if it isn't very fancy. I now have an 6s and I miss the size of my good old trust 4s.  "
9246,The iphone is pretty good works perfectly fine the internet could be a little faster othet than that its good
9247,My Iphone 4s is awful! It dies at 43% and I have to charge it at least 8 times a day. It barely holds any memory or pictures and am constantly having issues with it. I'm saving up for the newest iPhone soon!
9248,This is my current phone and I love it. I needed specially for the camera and it works perfectly
9249,This is the way to go I would probably prefer the one w/ more memory but being unlocked you can use w/ any service carrier. I'm currently using a samsung but will definitely be getting this one next.
9250,Its a nice phone however current software updates do not work well with this device slow phone and the battery does not last that long
9251,This phone was great up until about a year ago when the battery became trash.
9252,"I'm not quiet fond of how every thing has to be bought, the keyboard is small "
9253,For being an older generation phone it works fairly good. And I like tht it still gets software updates 
9254,Loveee this phone it's really nice to use hello recommend me for someone looking for a first phone
9255,I like my new iPhone but it sometimes freezes with no warning. But that's my only complaint!
9256,Was a good phone and I got a lot of mirage out of it!  I used this phone for at least 3 years before it died (and I dropped it a number of times!) easy to use and I was very happy with it. Only thing was I wish I had more memory space on it. 
9257,"I bought this as my first smartphone from a friend and paid 150. it lasted me 3 years after I moved on from Apple I went to Samsung and purchased the galaxy s4 mini. 
I would definitely recommend an iPhone for a person who has never had a smartphone before it is easy to use and dependable. "
9258,Sloooow. Freezes. Finally had to just go get an upgrade. Took forever for anything to load and the camera wasn't great either.
9259,"Love my 4s, very easy phone to start off with and also not as expensive as the other new apple phones, very compact compared to the 6s and has quite more width to it, but I've dropped mine a couple of times very brutally and have yet to crack the screen so I would say it's quite a sturdy phone too."
9260,"I loved my Apple 4S - up until the 5S came out - now the 6S (Plus 😉). 
Of course, I am an iPhone user. Have been for years now. If it's easy to use and safe to trust, why wouldn't I want this?"
9261,"The battery life is pretty terrible; I haven't had it long enough that I should have to replace the battery, but I did. It also doesn't run iOS9 well; it moves very slowly since I updated, but I can't run many of my necessary apps (like GroupMe) without the update, so I needed to update it."
9262,Love all apple phones. Definitely recommend them because they work amazing and the cameras are great
9263,I love my iPhone 6. It's light and easy to use! Next time I'm going to purchase the plus!
9264,"I use this every single day.  Actually a lot more than what I should.  I use my iPhone through straight talk and don't have the most up to date version but it works fine for what I use it for.  My home button sometimes gets dirty, with a case or without, and It sometimes becomes possessed and randomly will call people.   "
9265,"I love the app availability on this phone, not to mention the long battery life and large memory!"
9266,Very small screen compared to the new iPhones of course! As long as you get the 16GB and not the 8GB and don't care about having the latest verisions of apps and such you should enjoy this phone!
9267,"It is ok. My husband switched from a Samsung over to iPad and I'm not sure what he thinks. I have a Samsung and thought about switching but noooo I am sticking to Samsung, as my own opinion etc. I find it to be way better "
9268,Miss this phone it was the perfect size to fit in my hands should have kept it 
9269,This is my first iPhone and I really love like the size and I like everything 
9270,My husband is in love with his iPhone. he switched to Apple and will never go back
9271,"I've used my 4S for 3 years now and although the screens are not durable and neither are the Chargers, I like the apple software and refuse to use any other smartphone. "
9272,"Can not find a better brand. Easy to use and reliable. Only wish att had not changed their plan, otherwise I would have a 6 by now."
9273,"This is a nice phone with many features. The phone is smaller than the other versions, but it is heavier and easier to hold."
9274,"I love this phone so much because, after over a year of having it, it has not slowed down in the slightest. The phone I had before this slowed down to the point that I could no longer use it. It's Apple all the way from now on! "
9275,Buen Teléfono Toma Fotos Con Una Buena Calidad Tiene Una Excelente Señal Y Responde Rápido  No Se Tarda 
9276,"This is a good iPhone, it is still able to update but it's noticeably slower and less clear than the newer models. Many features are unavailable on this iPhone as it is an old model however I have not had any problems with it, it works very well and has done for almost 2 years. It's also survived a fair amount of knocks and drops, even a blue screen of death - and still coming out the other side working fine! "
9277,The iPhone is great! It has always worked great for me. No malfunctions or mishaps. Apple's customer service is great too.
9278,"I have has iphone in the past and every time I am dissapointing myself because the screens break so easy, cases and accessories are very hard to fund and there is not a lot of color option"
9279,It's a great phone and amazing design. I dislike the fact all music or ringtones must go through iTunes. technology this day and age should be basic and straight forward as it's used daily 
9280,"I love this phone so much, though recently it has become slow but maybe that's bc it's out of date."
9281,"It is a great phone! Fast and easy to get to the apps you need. But I still choose an Android over an apple phone. This phone gets complicated with simple settings, camera settings, doesn't have a hot spot, and you cannot input a memory card. "
9282,"I'm still using this phone and I love it, I haven't had any problems with it. Tons of storage & works everywhere I go"
9283,Good phone. one of the first iphones i had as a child. Now I am a loyal apple user and even have the iphone 6
9284,I love it so much fun and I have to . The best way for me is to eat it or kill you if I don't think that I can be the same thing 
9285,"I love everything about this phone, except for it's ability to break like no other. I have shattered so many iPhone's (even with cases on) Other than that, this phone is a great product. Lot's of storage and a great camera, not to mention gps, siri, and everything else that comes along with this phone."
9286,With rise of İphone 6 and İos 8 it couldn't catch them. I was very disappointed when Iwasn't able to load İos8 to my phone. Because of this I was forced to change it. Beside it the camera is actually good when you consider the year it launched. Beside it the glass screen on the front and on the back of the phone cause it to break vüreally quick . I hoped that it would be much stronger than it is.
9287,"It's not that bad, it's just it's really slow at times and it bothers me a lot, I'm just waiting for a new phone soon."
9288,I cannot say enough positive things about Apple.  I enjoy the simplicity and organization of these products.  
9289,Runs a bit slow because of being a few generations behind. Apple is a decent phone company. I like the features only available to iphone such as imessage and emojis :)
9290,It works fine and it's not too slow! Been using mine for years and there is not any problems so far.
9291,The iPhone 4s is alright. It's a bit slow but it still mostly works the same as the newer phones.
9292,Just being completely honest I do not currently have this phone. It was my previous phone and I was 100% obsessed. I never had any problems even after dropping several times. It's a very durable phone.  
9293,Omh I love to use iPhone I my all family and everyone love it too but I always don't like it 
9294,"I love this phone.  I used mine for almost 5 years.  The only reason I replaced it with a 5s is because it didn't have enough storage (16 GB just doesn't cut it).  Mine is unlocked, and I now use it when travelling...  Buy a pay-as-you-go SIM card, and it's good for the USA, Mexico, or Europe.  "
9295,"Mine is actually the 5s in white from Verizon & I do love it , it constantly updates so it never is old technology! Which is awesome , and Siri is so much fun how can you not lover her, ask her what does the fox say! Hilarious "
9296,"This is the best phone I have ever had by far enjoyed this it lasted me 3 years it would have lasted longer but it has been run over by a car don't ask loved this phone sooo much!!!!
"
9297,I loved this at first but learned to dislike it real fast apple charges you for everything
9298,"Good phone while i had it, unfortunetely  i had to replace it because it was running super slow and even opening an app was a 5 minute wait. "
9299,"This mobile phone works well, but now it looks a little bit old. It has a big memory and you can download loads of apps. The battery doesn't last longer."
9300,My poor little 4s! This phone has stuck with me through very hard times but I loved it! The back camera makes for good selfies if you're good at it! Doesn't do well with the new iOS updates but it was fun while it lasted.
9301,"Loved my iPhone 4, using a 6 now. Definitely  can't stay away from Apple products! "
9302,"My current phone, plus it is very light and easy to fit in my pocket. Call me lucky, but I am yet to damage the screen!"
9303,This was my first smart phone I got it from my mom 4 years ago. I know have upgraded through to the 6S plus. 
9304,"I loveeee my iPhone. minus the occasional glitches it works just fine & does everything I need it too 
"
9305,"I absolutely LOVED this phone.  I'm sure that if there would have never been an upgrade, I would probably still have it because this phone was great.  I liked that it was a little bit thicker and shorter.  "
9306,"I absolutely love my apply 4s. I rarely have a problem with Apple brands and when I do it's a super simple fix. Highly recommend 
"
9307,This phone is now out of date and crashes often. The battery dies very often on around 40% so a fully charged phone does not last long at all. It also fails with the new update and freezes. 
9308,"I love my Iphone to be honest I don't think I have a life without it. This Iphone is not my favorite, but if you don't have a lot of money this is quite useful <3"
9309,I have this phone currently. It's good not great the phone is a little slow but other wise not that bad.
9310,"Great and easy to use! I love it, my kids love it, my whole family loves Apple! Has great camera quality, great HD screen and easy to use"
9311,"Currently still have this phone, it works great still and is pretty durable. It is a lot slower compared to the newer models and mine tends to freeze a lot, but that's probably because I have had it for about four years now. I would recommend it to anyone who does not like to be 'in-trend' and anyone who drops their phone a lot. It is a good phone, I personally dislike it just because it does tend to freeze and turn itself back on when it is already on. "
9312,"Great phone. The camera is high quality, which is rare since it is a lot more affordable than the newer versions"
9313,What can I say about this phone that hasn't already been said. I'm addicted and in love. Will be holding on to this one until it's pryed from my hands.
9314,I love my phone i could upgrade but its the best model apples has ever made!
9315,"My Iphone 4 Lasted forever, I just upgraded to a 6 and still in love, the updates and ease of use are unmatched."
9316,It's kind of old but very useful. My phone is updated in iOS 9. IPhone 4s is small and useful for me as a student.
9317,I've had mine since 7th grade and I love the phone it will sometimes frustrate me and be wierd with me but I still love my phone
9318,"It's a good phone gets the job done, I really use a lot of graphics and the colors are good. "
9319,I love all Apple products and have been an avid iPhone user since my first smartphone. Will be upgrading to the iPhone 6 soon. 
9320,"I now have a 5s but let me tell you, when I had the 4s I had it for about 3 years and even though I could have gotten an upgrade I felt like I didn't need it because the 4s was awesome, it never failed! I had obviously dropped it a few times within the 3 years but it never broke or cracked and I never kept a case on it! I would still recommend the 4s to anyone, it is still an awesome already phone! "
9321,THIS iPhone is okay . Don't recommend but if u want it because it's cheap ok. It has very poor camera quality . Especially if ur recording . And it's very small 
9322,This phone is ok it does exactly what a phone should but seeing that the already have a 6s this phone is becoming more defective and not really working anymore 
9323,"Good quality phone , very strong and many applications are available to be downloaded ."
9324,"I switched from an android to an iPhone with the 4s a few years ago, and I haven't looked back. I used the 4s for a few years with no glitches or problems to speak of."
9325,MY BOYFRIEND GOT AN APPLE IHPONE 4S FOR FREE AT SPRINT BECAUSE HE BROKE HIS SAMSUNG AND HE USED TO HATE APPLE PRODUCTS AND ACTUALLY IS NOW IPHONE FOR LIFE!
9326,"It's a decently old phone but it works perfectly well! You don't need and brand new phone. You really don't, this one does the job. You can get almost all the same stuff as an iPhone 5 or 6. This is a good phone!"
9327,"I love this phone, couldn't live without it. Easy to use! I can't imagine ever being without it. "
9328,I love my iphone. It works great and I love that there are so many out there that you can buy a nice one that id only a year or two old for pretty cheap.
9329,If you are low maintenance and do not care about the very latest technology this is perfect. 
9330,"Great affordable phone. Although it's the older version, still works well. Good for kids. "
9331,There okay runs abit slow and want to upgrade to a 6 soon it is okay i suppose
9332,Still works I always drop it without a case and it hasn't broke yet I love apple products and I'm gonna get a iPhone 6s pretty soon
9333,"This classic version of the iPhone is perfect for those who live a simple life that's not so high tech.  I actually love this phone because its small and its size makes it easy to store since it fits conveniently in in almost every one of my pockets on most of my clothes.  However, The camera is very low quality and pictures come out looking pixelated up close.  The memory is also very limited and more storage is necessary to use most apps which you have to purchase and pay every month."
9334,Love my iPhone 4s.  It outlasted my galaxy which cracked after having it for only 2 months.  My iPhone has survived a toilet and being dropped from 30 ft.  
9335,"For my son being 11 this has been a great phone for him. It's durable, he's dropped it alot. And he uses it for all his games so storage is good. "
9336,"I had this phone for 3 years and never ever failed! This was the phone that lasted the longest with me and it still works! I bought a new iphone, but I saved my iphone 4s just in case something happens to the other one! I'm amazed how great it was! The only problem is that 16GB is nothing! I needed more space!"
9337,Love this phone. And the way it works with my apps and I can still do wok with my homework 
9338,Honestly the best phone version of the iPhone. It's honestly a part of my life. The size is perfect and I'm pretty hard on it with no damage. 
9339,Very slow and lagging new features if your gonna get a new phone please don't get this one 
9340,I remember having this phone. It was very reliable and great for on the go travels. Never has it disappointed me yet! 
9341,"I had a refurbished 4s, it worked most of the time.  but it liked to close out of my apps while using them, and stop working in the middle of calls. also it had a habit of sending texts to other people even tho I was in the same texts from Previous conversations."
9342,This phone is severely lacking one compared to the iPhone 5s. I did like it when I purchased it but it did seem to run kind of slow. I like the operating system a lot. Apple seems to keep all of my stuff together with my computer. The iCloud keeps me from worrying about losing any information. I had to upgrade at some point because this would sometimes shut off in the middle of a phone conversation. This phone is still better than any other fan that I've used from any other brand.
9343,"Lots of my friends have moved on from the 4s model, but I love it! I hardly ever have issues. My only complaint is how quickly the battery dies! "
9344,"Really slow and laggs, it drives my kids nuts. screen is fragile, already went through 2 of these phones for my kids due to shattered screens."
9345,"I purchased this phone when I decided I needed to have Siri like all of my friends. Quite honestly, most of the time I forgot the Siri option was even there. The phone lasted me two years and was still going strong when I gifted it to a family member so I could upgrade to a 6s. My reason for the upgrade? I didn't feel the photo quality was still up to par. Although fine at the time I got the phone, it seemed to deteriorate. "
9346,Absolutely love my iPhone! Don't know what I would do without it. Can never wait to get the next upgrade!
9347,I had this phone for about 2 years and I loved it. The apps are great and really convenient.
9348,Have! Screen cracked really easily. I fell down some outdoor stairs and it landed on concrete so it was a pretty hard drop 
9349,"Love my iPhone 4s, it might be my service but it does freeze a lot. sometimes it needs t be restarted and the front is not so clear."
9350,"Loved my 4s, but the battery always died quickly. 
I also had a hard time doing updates. "
9351,"I can't say enough about this phone.  We bought them for our teens and the durability is unmatched.  My daughters has been completely submerged - once in a lake and once in a puddle - and came out with minimal damage (external speaker doesn't work very well).  Of course, now the software doesn't keep up with newer apps, but for a starter phone for children, it is fantastic. "
9352,I had this phone for years before I upgraded to the IPhone 6.  This phone worked great for me most of the time. I didn't like that I could store everything I wanted to.  My Verizon service was excellent if I stayed in the NE area. Once I travelled to the SE I dropped called or didn't get calls. For the price of device and the phone I expected better.  
9353,I absolutely loved my iPhone and I miss it l. I switched to a Samsung galaxy and I like this one too but iphones are so expensive and overrated!
9354,"These older-model iPhones can be found fairly cheaply, but they can still run the latest version if iOS, so you don't have to worry about app compatibility.  Siri's there too, and just as helpful (or...not) as she is in other versions of the iPhone.  The 16GB model can hold enough tunes to get you through a commute, along with a decent number of apps and photos, but you won't be downloading movies and videos on this device.  Plus, if you're an app junkie like me, you'll find yourself deleting apps, photos, and music all the time to make room for the latest and greatest.

All told, it's still an iPhone with all that great Apple quality, but on the cheap.  If you aren't ready to invest in a newer upgrade, this one will still work for a while longer.  Beware, though... older models eventually become unsupported, and this one is now the oldest still-supported model, which means it will get cut with the next generation."
9355,Everything about this phone is awesome!! It's not large which I like. Connects with my iPad and iPod and makes picture and music sharing a breeze 
9356,I had this phone for three years and it worked so well until I dropped it of course 2 months ago then I had to go replace it but the picture quality was just not as good as it used to be. I assume its normal since is new updates and new phones coming out but overall this phone was really good and I do not regret having it for so long.
9357,"I'm completely in love with my iPhone 4S , although not the latest model of the apple I feel comfortable with the layout size of applications , all"
9358,"I love my iPhone. I used the 4s for almost 3 yes before upgrading to my current phone which is 6s. I find that the iPhone are so easy to user friendly. Even though most workplaces use PCs I still prefer using iPhone. The graphics, camera and speakers are just phenomenal. "
9359,"It sometimes  freezes which is really annoying and you have to reset. Also, the battery dies really fast so I have to carry my chord with me at all time. "
9360,"Loved this phone. 
I miss this phone but I dropped it and it smashed. 
The price to fix it was the same as buying a newer phone. "
9361,I love my iPhone and the memory it holds....tje pictures it takes are clear its almost like you were their in action 
9362,Loved this phone. No issues at all. Got a free upgrade and chose another iPhone! 
9363,Love my iphone! So easy to navigate through and it has a clean and simple design! Fav phone thus far 
9364,I had this a year or so ago.  At the time it was a great phone!! It was a good product 
9365,"I love Apple products I recently got this for my son and she loves. 
In white an unlock"
9366,Hated it. Never buyed it again. slow processor camera sucked but I liked it when it came out 
9367,"For a slightly older model of the iPhone, this one continues to keep up pretty well with the updates.  It is a good size and is manageable even with a case on it.  I tend to beat up my phones and this has stood up marvelously to being unceremoniously flung across the room on more than one occasion when I get too excited and talk with my hands.  All in all I have been very pleased with this device."
9368,Had this phone before I upgraded.  still works great after 3 years and having being dropped numerous times.  I use it now as.an ipod
9369,This phone has had a lot of use and still seems brand new. Super easy to use and the best apps available!
9370,It was a good phone for my first iPhone. I really enjoyed it until it broke.
9371,This thing is so ancient if you have one of these I'd recommend a upgrade from this phone.
9372,I've had one for ages and it's like my best friend and assistant haha I love it 
9373,"I love my 4s and my Verizon service! I have only had an issue once where out of nowhere my phone would not call out or anything, but I was able to reach my local Verizon location and they told me how to do a soft reset which saved the day! I also got a great price on this phone when the newer models came out. I wanted an iPhone but just couldn't afford the price. The one I have is a refurbished model, but they go through more testing than the freshly made ones is what the seasoned Verizon employee explained to me. I also got a great plan! I prepay just 45/month and have the best service around. I honestly went to other phone stores first thinking Verizon was too expensive, and after standing there 5 minutes or more in several stores and not even being acknowledged I was out of there! My local Verizon has someone waiting at the front door to see what the customer needs and either help or get them to the right employee that can! Love my phone, love my service!"
9374,Great phone. The real downside plus that you have to go through iTunes for all apps and music and they are very expensive. 
9375,Switched to Verizon because of the poor customer service from ATT. Iphones are great and I may never be able to switch because I'm so used to the format of the iphone now. 
9376,"That is the exact phone I have right now. Just got a new one because my old one the back camera had a crack in it. So, I needed a new phone."
9377,"It's stucked so many time. Sometimes, it has black screen and I didn't know how to fix it. Home screen had to try really hard to able to turn it on. Most of time I couldn't listen o music or watching video with sound, have to plug earphone in."
9378,"Awesome phone, enjoyed being able to download iTunes music and listen to it."
9379,"MI BEBE HERMOSO, LO ADORO, SOLO ME DIO UN POCO DE LATA CON EL WI FI PERO LO SOLUCIONE RAPIDAMENTE PERO SI ES UN DETALLE ADEMAS SE CALIENTA MUCHO"
9380,"Bad product probably the worst app,e phone ever. Lagged too much and shut down by itself"
9381,Seriously best quality phone ever will never ever crack I drop it sooo much an it doesn't budge because of the thickness I've had it for 2 year now I'm gettin the 6 but o know my 6 will dedinetly crack unlike this amazing phone by Apple.
9382,"I still love 4s more than any other. It's just perfect, the size, the system, everything. Totally recommended."
9383,Loveit .. the only orobllem is hw liitlle storage there is... for ome reason i can onlu have a few apps
9384,Not my favorite phone. I had so many problems with my  iphone. just not my type of phone.
9385,Once you own an apple product it is near impossible to own anything else. I absolutely love my phone 
9386,It's really small and starting to get slow I've always loved the 4s even though people made fun of me for it
9387,Love this phone and would definitely recommend Apple is a great brand! Love 
9388,"Iphone by far is the best phone choice possible! I love that I can link my phone, laptop, and ipad together.  I can get all my pictures and texts on any device!"
9389,"So glad I have the 5s now. I liked this phone while I had it, but it wasn't until I was able to upgrade my phone to the 5s that I realized how slow this phone was. Very very slow. And it had an awful camera, everything was shaky, like I took the photo on the top of a roller coaster going 30mph or something, even when I was completely still!!! Again, I'm so glad I have the 5s now, and can't wait until I can upgrade for the iPhone 6s"
9390,Technologic products get better and better everyday so I would not go back to this phone but I was very happy using it back in the day.
9391,"I got my 4s back in 2012. It's been ran over, dropped hundreds of times, and thrown here and there and it STILL works. Never cracked probably because of the case, but the buttons never broke either which I found interesting because my other friends with the same phone had that problem. It is a defect of this model, but it won't break if you take care of it. It's processor is slower in comparison to my other phones (Note 2 and iPhone 6s) but it's good to FaceTime or message when I don't have my laptop on me. "
9392,"This has lasted us years and now our 4s has been handed down to our son! So it's safe to say that it is well worth the money 
"
9393,"Even though most people always complained about how easily they would scratch or break, I never had an issue with mine. For the YEARS I've had it not once has it even gotten a scratch "
9394,I like iOS because it's my favorite but when you charge your phone and use it while it's charging for a while it starts to use it battery life
9395,"The system of the phone are fast. The color is beautiful and the quality of the camera is amazing, i love this phone."
9396,"Gran equipo, no da errores y se mantiene actual a pesar de ser de unos añitos atras, me encanta"
9397,Love it. its mt 3rd iphone and i am a total apple fan. once you go apple you cant go back to android!
9398,I liked it. Easy to use. My grandkids were even able to use it. Liked all the things that could be downloaded. 
9399,LOVE my iPhone 4! I would be lost without it! Minimal technical issues and very user friendly. I am not looking forward to having to upgrade. 
9400,The home button died on this phone and battery started to get old. But overall the phone worked great. 
9401,"Excellent quality in every way : image , video , sound speed of the device , you have the world at your fingertips ."
9402,Absolutely love this phone and everything about apple products!  It's been extremely durable and reliable for the last 3 years for me!
9403,The system is easy to use but the quality of the phone is not so good. It has so many problems since I brought it. 
9404,"I love my iPhone, I think that it's a great piece of technology for any age group. The battery life is about 10 hours, which is suitable for me as a student."
9405,"I really love Iphones, make everything so easy that when you try another phone you can understand anything "
9406,The iPhone 4S was a very reliable phone with the talk-to-text and Siri component. I have used both of these features to send a quick message to friends or locate a place. It is a great phone to use. 
9407,Love my phone! Apple is the best..has the greates apps and is very awesome! Wouldn't trade it for anything.
9408,I always loved my blackberry but my husband got me this phone as a gift. It was so simple to use and it fits easily in my pocket.. I have a 2 year old and I drop it all the time and it have never broke I have had it for 4 years and never had a problem. 
9409,"I had this , it was ok , but man the dam plug for the charger always get ruin for me and the screen just to tiny ."
9410,"This brand of phones is the best I've had , I love my iPhone 4S is very faithful to me and very good phone
"
9411,"I have never wanted to kill a phone more than I wanted to kill my 4s. It was deathly slow after being seriously babied the entire year and had every update available/ I had it and people say it was due to my carrier but now that I upgraded (because, you know, brand loyalty) it works just fine. "
9412,This was my first smart phone and I've been using it for 2+ years and it's still going strong!! I love my iPhone! 
9413,Absolutely love my Iphone4S. It does have glass on both sides making it very delicate but thankfully I've never broken it. 
9414,I still was not read for an upgrade to Apples bigger selection of phones. My phone has enough space in it and lets me multi-task stay on top of emails and get to my destinations because I rely heavily on GPS. Its perfect
9415,"We love our iphones.  We've had three different ones and  even after we're done using them as phones, we use them as ipods.  Our 4s has been used daily for nearly 4 years!  We've never had a single problem with it."
9416,I literally use this phone more than any other product although i do miss out on a lot of apps that require Ios8 and higher i still find this device very useful in my day to day use. 
9417,I use to have the 42 until upgrading and it was an awesome first I phone! I loved it apple is the best
9418,"Apple iPhone is great for tech lovers....as well as tech dummies like myself! The 4s model was my first smartphone and it did a good job of making the transition from a basic phone smooth and painless! One if the key selling points for me is that iPhones can text other iPhones when out of cell svc range if there is wifi.....which, in my case means my mother and I can text each other from our respective homes which we could not do before (rural area)! My only small complaint is that the battery life is not what I needed. (An issue resolved by iPhone 6!)"
9419,"This was my very first IPhone and it was great, I dropped it many times and it's never cracked. I also had it for 3 1/2 years before I bought the 5C back in January of 2015. "
9420,"Great phone, but the 16G is not a lot of storage. unless you're in a pickle, I suggest a phone with more storage for photos, music, etc. Apple is always great and user friendly though."
9421,I'm not a fan of apple products. You can't edit anything like you can on an Android to really make it your own. 
9422,When I upgraded to a 5s I held onto this phone as a backup instead of trading it in. When I recently cracked the screen on my 5s I used it until I got my 6splus and it was a trooper! Still holding onto it!
9423,"The iPhone 6S may have just come out, but my handy dandy iPhone 4S still works perfectly fine! "
9424,"No longer top of the line (though that does not take long with phones) but the perfect size for my toddler, and she loves using it to FaceTime her grandparents and friends.  While I sometimes wish it had more memory, it does the job for my toddler, and her father before her!"
9425,This iPhone rocks! Bought it 4 years ago and it's still working great! Highly recommend it!
9426,Stick with the tried and true old school iPhone 4s. It's perfect for my lifestyle and has the memory I need to keep up with my apps. Love it!
9427,Personally in my own opinion i like this phone like the signal is great .....
9428,"This was the first iPhone I ever had. I got it on sale last year. I love the iOS layout and performance. I think it is a great phone. However, it ran some apps very slow (Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) This isn't always a big deal for some people, but it was for me. It was also extremely small, and I found myself dropping it a lot. I also had trouble hearing incoming phone calls unless I put it on speaker, but that could have just been my particular phone. Overall, a pretty great phone, especially a starter smartphone for someone!"
9429,"I know that this isn't the newest model and all, but the iphone 4 works perfectly for what I need it to do and I've had no problems with glitches or anything. Also, apple phones are like the easiest ever to navigate!"
9430,This phone has a small screen and takes average pictures. Other than that it seems to have all the other features of the newer iphones
9431,"Highly durable and long lasting. No need to upgrade if it is not broken. Does almost everything the new iphones do, with a few exceptions of course"
9432,Phones are ok. Battery life is crap though. Screens seem to crack easier than other phones I've had in the past and memory is never even close t what product claims due to so many unnecessary apps and programs being installed and unable to remove.
9433,"In LOVE with Iphones! Seriously the smartest things out there!! Also, LOVE the Siri option. I am always on the phone, but when I drive, Siri is my GO-TO! The only problem I've encountered with the 4S, and I'm not sure if others with the 4S have encountered this problem (or if I just have a bad one), every once in a while, like once every 2 months, my phone will shut off randomly, and wont turn back on for like 10/15 minutes. Its weird, and unfortunately not from a dead battery.. It will happen randomly! Like at 80%! Anywho, great phone! Just ordered the 6 and cant wait to get it!!"
9434,Aún tengo mi iphone 4 y es un muy bien tlf el único problema es la poca memoria que tiene 8gb es muy poco 
9435,"Not used the 4s but my husband had it and he loved it very much at that time, so i think its a great phone"
9436,THIS THING WAS GREAT BEST PHONE EVER WHAT A THROWBACK WOULD USE THIS IF MY PHONE BREAKS 
9437,This phone is great for my business. I can multitask while on the phone with a client. also great for GPS and taking notes on the go.
9438,This is a very good phone! It takes great pictures that are very clear. The sound quality is great and I love how much memory it has.
9439,Love my iPhone. I've had it for a while now and I love it so much. I think k would be so lost if I went to another brand 😂
9440,Not a huge fan of this iPhone. I have always been a Droid girl so having to switch to Apple was confusing for me. I will be going back to Droid (Samsung) as soon as possible. 
9441,"Love Apple iPhone so much, I wish I had more storage. Mine is 8 G, and I have to transfer photos to my computer every week in order to have enough storage space"
9442,Love the iPhone 6 so much better though I need to invest in a good case because it is fragile. 
9443,"This phone is great for everyday use, the battery last a good while for the amount of time I'm on it."
9444,All iphone ithink  they  are  great   like idk  its  just thefeel  of  it  the style   and  the feautures  is awayits  better  than  any   other  if   you   use   android   goo to  iphone  and  just  try  it   and   compare
9445,Great phone I had it for years before upgrading. There isn't much difference in this and the newer ones besides size and maybe the fingerprint scanner.
9446,I love it just sad that the screen has broken on me but fixed it and put a screen protector on it so it will be more protected 
9447,Sprint service is beyond terrible on top of that I am pretty sure that after 2 years iPhone batteries become worthless. I enjoyed my phone when I first got it but after a while the battery would drain in a few hours. 
9448,"Easy to use, great features, lots of apps, excellent quality and sound, lightweight , go shopping on your phone!"
9449,I had this phone since it came out and it was the best iphone at the time! It worked great and was all I needed in a phone. I have since upgraded after new phones came out though!
9450,Love the iPhone but this one doesn't have a lot of memory. I will be buying the 6 soon for more memory. Other than the memory usage I love the phone.
9451,"Im not usually the person who goes and buys the last iphone, i had this one for sooo long! Totally worth the money i paid for it"
9452,"I love all apple product. I have the iPhone and I love how clear my photos are and it's multi functional as well. There were times that I wanted to switch due to curiosity, but what keeps me loyal is their photo features and I love the sound on my music section as well~ "
9453,Worth the money but the screen looks a little smaller as compared to the 6S in the market. But it's a sturdy phone and wont bend or break in the pocket. It can rough it out a little bit so good for you if you have kids around. 
9454,"This iphone was a great size, I hate they keep getting bigger. When this came out it was the bee knees, but with all the updates it is worth upgrading! "
9455,LOVE my phone!  I will always buy Apple brand.  There is no comparison.  No problems at all with this one.
9456,"Team iPhone right here. They are more fragile, yes, but it's an amazing design that you can't get with any other phone. They are more expensive, yes, but quality is priceless especially on an item you use daily! "
9457,I loved this phone. It was my very first iPhone purchase. It was user friendly and reliable. I only stopped using it for an upgrade. 
9458,I had this phone and it worked really well. I now use it as my iPod but it was worth it 
9459,"I recently broke my phone so my friend, that had a spare one, gave me her iPhone 4S in black as an early Xmas gift! How amazing is she? This phone definitely maked my life a lot easier than ever. It's clean, simple and exclusive, just how I like it."
9460,"I actually have the Rose Gold, which I absolutely love! I have had previous versions of the iPhone and find the battery life in this one to last much longer. If you love Apple, I'd definitely recommend this! "
9461,Iphones are the easiest phones to use. i love the quality of the pictures. but if you take a lot of pics then you would need more then 16gb
9462,Don't do it. Slow as heck. Can't do anything. Horrible camera quality. Just bad.  
9463,Love love love all the iPhone's I have owned. never let me down one bit in the past 6 years. #teamiphone 💕📱
9464,I had this phone for 3 years and I loved it but it broke in the bathroom.  It was simple for me 
9465,So glad Apple came out with a bigger iPhone. I have big hands and the other versions were too small when typing. I had a lot of typos and had to keep correcting every word. But this bigger design is awesome.
9466,Absolutely love it!! I never receive any spyware or have to worry about Apple giving my information over to anyone! Very trusted company very trusted product
9467,It's ans okay phone it freezes sometimes and I really want the iPhone 6 so once I get an upgrade that's what I'm switching to 
9468,"The first 3 months, I thought this was the best purchase I've ever done. I really loved it. When the time passed, and I've got excited with all the new applications, i started disappointing with it.
I've bought the iPhone that comes with 8GB (the cheapest one), and that was my problem. They shouldn't even sell celphones with such a low saving capacity. I have to delete photos everiday, and if I want to download a new app, I have to delete another one.
It also became slower and slower every time I update its sistem (which should make your smartphone better, not worse)."
9469,I love iPhones they are easy to use there are so many apps available. Although it is slow especially with the newer phones that have come out and newer updates.
9470,I definitely enjoyed this phone to the fullest and would have loved to stay with apple phones until I shattered mine and couldn't afford a new one. 
9471,My 4S is so out of date now I can't fully update a lot of the apps I use on the regular.  Time to switch to a 5. :(
9472,I had an iPhone 4S for 2 years. It was my first iPhone. I have since upgraded to an iPhone6 and gave the 4S to my 8 year old daughter. She uses it now for her games & wifi and loves it! Longest lasting phone I've ever had! 
9473,I would not recommend the i phone 4 because it is old and I am sure you would rather have one of the updated I phones.
9474,Omg omg omg you should really get this I have this one and it is so amazing yeahhhhhhhhhh
9475,I love everything about this phone except the poor camera quality. I liked the pictures just fine until I had the upgrade. Then it got stolen and I had to go back to this one and the photo quality made me sad.
9476,I no longer owned a iphone 4 but I gave it alway to my mother shes not so much into new phones so it was perfect for her she said it was easy to navigate 😉
9477,"I love this phone.  I did not have a smart phone before, and I am amazed how much of a difference it makes to my life.  "
9478,"You can't go wrong with apple iphones. sleak phones, only downfall for me is the apple store. "
9479,This was the old phone I had and I loved it! It kept up with me and my daily tasks and it never had any issues. I wish the screen was a bit bigger but I guess that's why the upgraded phones have bigger screens :)
9480,"As always, this is a reliable Apple product. With this older model however, many features, apps, and updates are making it out of date, and nearly obsolete. At this point, I would not recommend purchasing this model, as functionality of it is no longer at its best. When it was one of the newer model out, I would have given the sky the stars and highly recommended it."
9481,"Great phone! Always love apple products, especially the iPhone! Great quality and battery life. "
9482,"Sooooo, last year i decided that i was going to switch it up and go back to Andriod, Oh boy was i wrong. I immediately switched back to Apple and this was the phone that i got. i love it. "
9483,"I love my iPhone. It's great quality, easy to navigate and the amount of  educational/fun apps they offer for children is awesome. (And if you have kids you know your phone is no longer just yours)"
9484,Absolutely in love with my iPhone! I don't really like how thin the newer phones are so I opted for the 4s. It's small and sturdy but it also stores a lot. The one thing I do wish is that it'd have better camera quality. 
9485,"I had my first iPhone for over three years, so I can say with out any uncertainty, these phones can take A LOT. I'm pretty gentle with mine, but it does get a lot of use. The only con to mine was that it ran out of memory pretty quickly, so I constantly have to dump everything from my phone to my computer. But other than that, she's been by my side for a very long time, and for that I am grateful."
9486,Love this phone no issues very  happy  with it   lots of memory and   storage and easy use
9487,This was my favorite iPhone and I had it in white I got rid of Apple though cause it fell on carpet and shattered even with a case too delicate.
9488,I had a 4 now I got the 4s. So much room for storage. Love talking to siri and also the camera features and the memory for the photo album is awesome. Let you store pics for a month even afar you delete it in case you change your mind
9489,"I'm ready to upgrade, but this has been a great phone. No issues and great battery power"
9490,I upgraded from the iPhone 4 in June. The old one could barely hold a charge and I was going to be travelling abroad and  needed a more reliable phone. No complaints so far. 
9491,"Me facina la rapides con que realiza las acciones, ademas no se trata nada, no es supentible a a virus, por el tipo de OS, que maneja."
9492,"Loved this phone when it worked. Then all the problems ensued wi-fi cable broke, lock button stopped working and then it just shut and never turned back on. Probably will never buy another iPhone."
9493,"Im an oldy, i always like the smaller screens, apple products are the bomb.com so go buy it
"
9494,I had this phone a couple years ago and loved it! It had plenty of storage space even though I only had the 8GB. It held tons of pics and several pages of apps. It was fast when using it and never froze up. I actually missed it when I upgraded! 
9495,I don't like the fact that the battery can't be changed out.  I am not a big fan of the iPhone right now and just wish I would have never switched from my droid.
9496,"Very classic modern feel. This phone is very organized and it's not full of clutter and apps I don't need. It's runs great, I love making videos and FaceTime "
9497,"This was my first phone. It worked really well except for the battery life. I just traded it in about a year ago, but I sometimes miss it."
9498,"Ok so this one was my first iphone and i have no regrets about it, its perfect."
9499,"I've always loved the Apple iPhones, and this one was bought for my stepson.  I'll be getting the 6 soon!"
9500,As silly as it sounds i purchased this phone unlocked for my daughter who is too young to have a cell phone but at the moment its being used as an iPod touch but if it makes her happy I'm happy and it works great as a back up :)
9501,The one thing I can say about iPhone is that it is dependable! I always know what to expect and I don't have to worry about the unknown. The phones are sturdy and there are so many options. Accessories are abundant as well. I highly recommend if you are looking for a good dependable phone!
9502,Got this as a gift from my aunty I loved this phone so much till the screen broke 😢 but will be getting it fixed. Most definitely recommend getting one .
9503,The camera is SO HORRIBLE!! ALSO it is very heavy... Feels like I am carrying a brick in my pocket. 
9504,This was an upgrade from the iPhone 3s. User friendly and it is still being used today by my husband. It is now 3 years old and works and looks like new!!
9505,All I'm gonna say is......... I miss my iPhone. So going back when I can upgrade again!
9506,Use to have this phone great phone I'm pretty sure these only cost .99 now 
9507,Works great.nice buttons easy to read screen great display. great sound i would buy another one.
9508,This phone will last your forever its very dependable and thats what i love about it I'm about to get the 6s because i need an upgrade but the 4s has really stood up the test of time and still functions great to this day but because its getting older a lot of updates are happening with social media and the 4s cannot use a lot of the new updates
9509,"I bought this for my son, he loves it. Easy to use, great picture quality. I just wish the battery life was better. "
9510,Iphone is really good. I love this model the best so far. It takes great photos too. I got mine on sale for a super deal good deal!!
9511,Works amazing. I've had the same phone for a very long time and it hasn't failed me yet. It's nearly indestructible.
9512,Love my apple phone the best easy to use lasted with me for years now won't go out of style
9513,"Loved this phone buy like any other iPhones, they became too slow for me overtime. "
9514,"I had this phone before I recently upgraded. It was great! Plenty of storage for me and never crashed or lagged. The battery did get a little funny after 2 years of use though, and I ended up getting and external to supplement. "
9515,I hate this phone! It runs slow and never seems to need an update but everyone else does! I can not wait to say good bye to this phone and go back to Samsung!
9516,"Mi teléfono favorito sin duda de los mejores tiene muy buena memoria, el tamaño del celular esta muy bien no estorba mucho  la resolución de la cámara es increíble toma fotos muy padres sin duda de los mejores que ha sacado apple. "
9517,This was one of my most favorite models of the iPhone. The size was perfect. I wish they would make one closer to this size but just as powerful as the 6. 
9518,Very good phone. has many cool settings an all. nothing big change as time passed by beyond its size
9519,Love this phone. I have upgraded to the 6plus but I still have my 4s just incase something happens to the new one. Locke I phones will never go to another brand.
9520,It doesn't work as well now as it did before. every software update seems to make it more sluggish and slow.
9521,This was my favorite out of all the iPhone before haven't upgraded so I wouldn't know about the others but this one gave me siri she was awesome!
9522,This lasted so long ..... It was nice and a little brick. Easy to use for a new apple user. 
9523,"Este es el teléfono que estoy usando ahora. Me gusta, no tengo ninguna queja de el. Lo único que no me gusta es que ya he cambiado 3 veces su cargador"
9524,"Had this phone for quite a while. But now that iOS has constant updates, the 4S is losing its capability of keeping up with the latest software and coding "
9525,"Currently using this. Time for an upgrade. But I have to say this phone has met my expectations by lasting me just over 3 years now. The photo quality is ok, but it does what it can. The only thing is the IOS upgrades - you have to do it so frequently now. Change is good but in time."
9526,"I am currently using this phone, I don't really like it. I can't get good IOS and it's very very slow. I want the iphone 6s rose gold color.  "
9527,Great phone. I only switched to the note 4 because I wanted a bigger screen and my upgrade was due.
9528,I give it four stars because my household is still using a Apple 4S IPhone but we do not have it with Sprint.
9529,"IPhones are overrated in my opinion. Almost half of the memory is used up by system needs and you have a ton of apps that you can't delete that are built into the phone. On top of that, iPhones are just ticking time bombs. No matter how well you take care of it, it will eventually start glitching and you'll have to buy a new one. If you aren't already sucked into the apple world, try to stay away. "
9530,I love all apple products so I knew this would be great. The phone is a life saver you can do so much on it that it keeps me organized with everything 
9531,Trusty and reliable unless it drops into water. While rice and those things work- even if it is recovered I have noticed that the battery drains much faster with the iPhone 4s.
9532,I previously had this phone but upgraded to a 5c then a 6. I had some speaker issues with this phone but that was after over a year of use. For the most part a good phone just upgraded
9533,I love my iPhone 4s. I used to own a droid. Didn't have any reason to want to change phones. My daughter bugged and bugged me till I got the apple iPhone 4s. I love it. Now I would be lost without it. The only change I will ever make is to upgrade models. I love iPhones. Super easy to use and it updates itself and I can fix a lot of issues thru iTunes. 
9534,I'm terrible with cell phones- constantly dropping and damaging them. This particular iPhone endured a rough life and never died on me! Even survived just fine after water damage!!
9535,"I Love IPhones But I Jus , Couldn't Handle The Iphone 4s ..... But I Think Ive Got The Perfect One "
9536,Love my iPhone! I have always loved them. Have had slight issues but can deal with them.
9537,This was a decent phone. I was happier once I upgraded to the 5. I like the larger screen and can wait to upgrade again.
9538,I still own this phone and its the worse! Please urge you to buy the upgraded versions!! 
9539,"This was my first iPhone and it lasted years! I love Apple products, nice and easy to use. The screen shattered which was the only downside to it..."
9540,"I had tons of issues with my first smartphone, an android. I didn't have any issues with my 4s. I would definitely recommend an apple phone. "
9541,"Love this phone. It's super durable & doesn't break easily. It's functional, & the software is updated frequently. Very happy with this product. "
9542,LOVE IT IT WORKS WELL AND I LOVE THE CAMERA AND IT IS SO EASY TO NAVIGATE THAT I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM
9543,Had this phone when it first come out!! It's a great iPhone never had a problem with it! Loved it 
9544,This phone has the worst battery life you can ever possibly dream of. i literally can charge it all night and play with it for 5 minutes and have it die on me 
9545,I had to get a replacement phone since mine was dropped in water and have always had no problems with an IPhone.
9546,3 years later the phone still works although the home button fell out (taped it in lol) and the phone itself started to freeze and turn on & off. But it survived falling (I dropped it about 10 times within those 3 years) so the screen still looks great not cracked. 
9547,"My husband and I both got this phone in mid-2011, and just upgrade from it after four years last week.  For the majority of the time we had the phones, they were excellent--even withstanding multiple falls and drops in water without quitting.  They only just began to give us some trouble within the last six months--saying goodbye to that workhorse was bittersweet!"
9548,"I have had Verizon for years and this exact same phone. I always have the best service anywhere I go. No matter how far in the country we live, I am still able to use my Iphone"
9549,"My first smart phone. I got it refurbished. I don't care if the iphone6 is out. This is still a great phone! I really don't need a lot of bells and whistles, but love the calendar app...and the customizable alarms...aslo the fact that you can put your phone on ""do not disturb"" and can turn the ringer off just by flipping a switch."
9550,Worked well until the update came and then it slowed down dramatically. Upgraded to the 5 
9551,This was my first smartphone and I loved it. It exceeded all my expectations at the time. Although after 2.5 years of use the battery life was very poor.
9552,I had this phone for about 3 years before I upgraded & for those 3 years this phone has done its job 
9553,Excellent product!!! I really like and recommend it 100% to everybody. its fantastic cell
9554,I don't have an apple computer but I know of people with them! They wouldn't get any other type
9555,Before my plus i had my iphone 4s! Love apple i never have hAd any problems and love that fact that it pairs up with my mac. 
9556,I really loved this phone when I had it. I feel that it was a perfect size to fit anywhere. Just needed more memory. Love apple. 
9557,Over all the best iphone for the price the 5 and 6 break on me easily and this little baby has held up through it all! yeah call it old and out dated but it has kept up longer then my other apple products  
9558,Great phone used for 2 years before upgrading now daughter uses as iPod and loves it
9559,"An older phone but still works great if you don't want to spend a bunch of money on a newer model. 
"
9560,I only purchase apple products. To me they're the best and most dependable. I've dropped my phone so many time and it never broke. Maybe I'm just lucky. But definitely recommend any apple iphone!
9561,The only thing I don't like about apple is that you have to purchase most apps and music. 
9562,Had this phone for three years and loved it. Switched to this from an android and while it was a little different at first but I don't think I could go back to the android system
9563,Love the unlocked version because you can take it anywhere to any country and use it. Love.
9564,"Although it's a later generation its still an amazing phone. Plus, the updates keep it somewhat still in the competition with the newer generations."
9565,"
I do not like this phone so small that I have the iphone plus 6s and I really like and not as great as people say this super comfortable when you get to use a time. "
9566,This was my favorite size iPhone. Still has the front facing camera and fits everywhere!
9567,"I love my apple phones been on board with the first iPhone now I have the 6splus!!! Love the easy ability to do Everything..
"
9568,"Great phone. I got it brand new in the box off eBay last Christmas and it was a big step up from my very old 3GS. Love the front facing #selfie camera and the camera was just very improved overall with HD video. I also love Siri and all the things I can do, I'm always behind in phone technology but I'm looking forward to getting the 5 or 6 soon. "
9569,This was my first iPhone and I still feel nostalgic towards it.  It's a hardy iPhone which has survived me and now my children. I will always love this iPhone!
9570,"This was my very first big phone purchase and I absolutely loved it. I have since graduated to the 6 plus; but I have no doubt that if I were to turn this baby back on, it would be in perfect working condition. "
9571,"Doesn't  break easily, if you have a case it should not crack easily. The phones speed is decent."
9572,"When I first bought this phone in July, I knew it was a little outdated. For the first few months, it worked well, with no problems. In the last month, however, several of my apps have stopped updating due to the age of the phone. Additionally, the phone itself is causing many of my apps to crash, and my internet speed to slow significantly. While it works fine other than that, I would not recommend purchasing this phone unless you have no other options, price wise."
9573,I have had this phone for about 6 years and I only had to pay .99 cents at AT&T. I really do love Apply products and their customer service is always great. I really do need to upgrade to the iPhone 6s lol
9574,My phone always making loud noises and I can never get into Apple to get it fixed.. Wish they made it easier to get service .. Overall the phone is not my favorite 
9575,"Love my iPhone. It's the best. I love the apps, the emojis and the Siri. I also appreciate the iCloud and the ability to share between my iphone and iPod."
9576,I do love the 4s. Super small and fits very conveniently in very small places. I have upgraded to a 5 but miss this!
9577,Good starter phone if you're new to iPhone. All the basics and decent price. Just upgraded but had this forever
9578,I love my Apple iPhone 4s. It's user friendly and always works great! Highly recommended. 
9579,"Is a really old version of iphone but is what i got but is perfect is It is very resistant to falls and i love it is my baby
"
9580,"I've had this phone for 3 years before upgrading it. However, toward the last year or so, I started experiencing battery issues."
9581,So far soo good with apple products! They are easy to use and hardly any problems. Love apple
9582,"Great phone, does everything I  need it to do and then some! I love having my life at my fingertips "
9583,I still use the Iphone 4s because I have had no reason to replace it! This phone is probably one of the better phones I have ever had.
9584,Mine would never stay charged and ultimately I had to upgrade because of that.
9585,I love apple products! Can not wait to upgrade!!! I wouldn't go to any other phone. 
9586,I really liked this phone would buy again if the price was lower easy to use 
9587,"I LOVE Apple Products. I Would Def. Say Go With Verizon, And Get As Many GB's as You Can.
I Really Want A New iPhone =)"
9588,"I'm always slow on the upgrade, but I love all of the new(-to me) emojis, apps, bells and whistles."
9589,I wish I could go back to this phone it is the best phone ever created from Apple 
9590,Had this type a while ago. Updated to a 5C but I love an apple phone. It's simple and easy to use. 
9591,Oh man I love this iPhone 4s I had this phone for 4 years  never got trouble with it . Has bunch storage you can really download bunch of apps I love works I loved everything about I dropped it water I think pretty much dropped much of times I lost count still was working I lost phone broke my hear then I up greater 6s now I'm in love with it as much as I love 4s
9592,"I loved my iphone, but didn't like that i had to text one letter at a time so i went back to an android "
9593,Apple Computers Apple iPhone 4s 16GB Smartphone (Black) (Unlocked) is a great phone.
9594,"If you want a phone that doesn't crack, put a good secure case on it as well as a screen protector! also, the more you update your phone, the slower and buggier it gets! "
9595,"Being as this smart phone has many alternate uses, have to say it is exceptional value and makes perfectly clear voice calls ."
9596,Love my I phone! I usually buy all apple products. I'm counting the days until I get my Iphone 6. Dependable and user friendly.
9597,This was my old phone..swtiched to 6 now..But this one never gave me any troubles. So it is perfect
9598,I enjoy the apple 4s a lot better than the 5. The only problem I've had with the 4s is that I can only talk to people on speaker phone or they won't hear me. 
9599,"I have had zero problems with my phone every since I got it. Other phones, I've had issues with maintenance and this phone gives me no issues. "
9600,I switched from an android to apple products starting with the 4s.  I haven't looked back!  Some battery life issues which is standard with smart phones because of their multi purpose ability!
9601,I have owned and still own apple electronic devices.  my apple iphone 4s still works perfect and I love it and beyond.  it has never gave me any difficulties if you have not owned one then I don't know what to really say to you other then go BUY one. you all will love it.  I cant believe I still have mine until know. its been about 4-5 years.  and hopefully I plane on keeping it for a longer time.  its still nice and not broken.  Apple is very trusted and I love all of there items.  
9602,"I have always been able to count on Apple to keep going which is beautiful. The only cons I can really say about this is that the sensitivity of the phone wears off, and the memory seems to dissappear much faster and you cannot add memory to them "
9603,I got this phone because my Samsung was stolen. Honestly I don't like it. It is so slow and shuts down apps when it gets confused - so annoying. I miss my Samsung. I swear apple makes their products to break down after 2 years max so you have to buy a new one.
9604,Probably my first Iphone. Good product from a good company. Never had any issues just ran out of storage. 
9605,It was a great phone while it lasted but I'm so thankful for an upgrade. I think Apple might slow the phone down when new ones come out. 
9606,"5 stars, because at the time they were the bomb. I recently had one cause I was in need of a phone.. Love apple, just dislike the small screen. Time to upgrade!"
9607,I still use mine for music and love it!!! I bought it straight out this phone has high ratings 
9608,"This was my first iphone. I loved the fact that Siri was
personalble. I loved the apps and the simplicity of 
the phone"
9609,We bought this as a replacement phone for my husband and he seems to really like it! It was hard for him to get use to the smaller screen but now he says it's a really good reliable phone.
9610,Never had any problems with this phone . In fact it was the first iPhone that I tried out .
9611,"My daughter has the new Iphone 6s and she loves it, She dropped it in the toilet and guess what it works,  The cost is a lot but you get what you pay for as for me I have a Samsung and I love my phone"
9612,"Daughters love this phone and a great starter one to see how they would treat them- definitely love apple products in my household
"
9613,"Love this Phone 
Very easy to use
small but strong
Great screen cant see any pixels 
siri is Perfect with this phone 
soo much fun to ask questions and take pictures with the bult-in filters 
GREAT Camera"
9614,Had a iPhone 4s and it was my holy grail. something about the iPhone just seems so neat and organised. not worries on where's the app or I can't find this app like most phones. 
9615,This phone is great for teens and college students.  Has all the functions you love about the Apple iphone with all the features of an ipod.
9616,Love it. I see nothing wrong with the 4s and have no plans to upgrade to a newer model. If the phone were a bit slimmer it would be perfect .
9617,I remember owning one of these and it was a little slow compared ro these new top models like the iphone 6s but i still liked it
9618,My mom used this phone. The camera was not the best and it would freeze up sometimes. The charger for it messed up often.
9619,"My phone dies at 40% and sometimes 50%, I randomly don't get internet/signal when it should be full connection, my phone dies in all of a half hour without use from fully charged. I will never go back to an iPhone."
9620,This phone always treated me well as long as I took care of it and made sure not to drop it. 
9621,"Soy Amante al sistema Apple , he utilizado este celular, no tube queja! Camara excelente, todo bien! 👍🏼👍🏼"
9622,Nice phone I can't complain too much. The home button did wear out after a while which sucks because it's the most used button
9623,"The 4s iPhone is a good phone but the newer generation phones have a lot more to offer, especially the 6s that has a drastically improved camera. "
9624,Love my iphone 4s!!! It is my favorite phone that I have ever had! It also is small and fits in my pocket! My favorite model out of all the iphones
9625,Easiest smartphone ever! Very user friendly for young and old alike! Very hardy too! I've dropped mine MANY TIMES and it's still kicking!
9626,This phone lasts for a long time. I have had mine since 2012 and it still works the same. I love this phone.
9627,This phone was great until all of the updates came out that made it pretty much not work at all!
9628,My last cell phone I loved it until the new updates came out and it slowed to a crawl. My husband still has the black one and he usually grabs my phone (iPhone 6) to use the web since his takes forever to do anything. Bulky compared to the new generation of iPhones. 
9629,There's really nothing else more to say. I have and always will be an Apple Iphone fan and supporter. The interface is just so user-friendly and appropriately compact. The design is sleek and very lovely. No complaints - maybe just the price haha.
9630,"I had my 4S for two years with NO problems at all. It wasn't until the very end of my contract, two weeks before the two year mark that the battery began to go on me. It made it through to the end though and was a good, steady, sturdy product despite falling into the shower and onto the ground many times. "
9631,I've had my 4s for about a year now and it is still very fast and loads things up in a couple of seconds. I've dropped it plenty of times and still hasn't got a crack in it. Great phone. 
9632,I got this phone for my music and got another for my actual phone and I LOVE apple products!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9633,"I like the Iphones they are so user friendly, specially someone like me who needs a book for dummies to understand any to do projects hihihi "
9634,"I had mine for about 2 years before I decided to finally give it up and get a new one. It was a great phone, I had dropped it in the toilet, a sink full of water, it survived being thrown by my 4 year old. I would have to say it is a pretty strong phone."
9635,"I got this a long time ago and I really like it. Its not huge and since I'm not on my phone that much anyway, I'm fine that its old. "
9636,"I'm a apple lover , I been having apple since they came out , I had this iPhone 4s was factory unlock and it was amazing, till this day I still have iPhone , definitely will recommend this. "
9637,"I really loved my apple phone - until I had to deal with iTunes. That was enough for me to pull my hair out with lapse in time to load, app crashes and limited ability to manipulate as I wanted.  Needless to say - I went to an Android and would never dream of going back to the restrictions of iTunes again. "
9638,I had this phone for years and dropped it so many times and it worked as new 😂
9639,I love apple product especially the FaceTime feature. Only negative is when you need a repair or replacement oh and the cameras glare at night
9640,My mom got this phone when I added her onto my Verizon contract about a year ago. The phone started randomly crashing about 3 months in and now will not charge.
9641,I pruchased this iphone and am every happy with it. i can use the phone and the computer in one. It has stays charged with is a nice feature
9642,"Thumps up for Apple .. No words need to say, everyone knows Apple better .. Cute sleek phone , slots of option , download apps easily , auto app download , easy function & easy to use "
9643,Slowwwwww as hell. bad camera and all that. cant get a lot of new apps because it requires higher ios. worth the extra money to buy a better phone.
9644,"I'm not a big fan of Iphones or apple. I used to have the iphone 4s, but switched to a samsung galaxy because I could not longer update my iphone because it was an older model and only the newer models could receive the update. "
9645,I like the iPhone 4s more than any other iPhone. I prefer Ios 7 over any other ios and I love how compact this phone was before they all started becoming too large. 
9646,This was my first iphone and I loved it until I upgraded. The screen is too small now but it as great initially. 
9647,First iphone! lasted me a great amount of time. it paired well with my macbook and iPod as well! 
9648,"I didn't like the 4s at all. Slow, low memory, and very blocky phone crammed into a small compact device. every time they did an update it was basically all of the memory my phone had... Awful"
9649,Not a fan of iPhone. Every phone I have runs out of space so you can't do updates. Phone breaks super easy.
9650,This was my favorite Iphone yet. It was the perfect size and feel..... not to mention the speed as awesome
9651,"Love the apple phones and technology they have, I don't use many apps on my phone  but they have some cools apps and the camera resolution is great "
9652,Love love love this phone. Apple processing systems are so very simple and easy to use. Camera is great. Phone is overall easy to use. 
9653,"Was not a fan of the iPhone at all.
It was slow and my screen cracked the month I bought it."
9654,I had this phone two years ago. What really like about Apple products is that they are simple to use. 
9655,"Had this before I upgraded to the 6. I really liked the size of the 4s and I never had many issues with it. Overall, a really reliable phone with good customer service from Apple. "
9656,"Love the phone and the apps, lately it has been locking up on me and battery life is not as it used to be, constant recharging is required. "
9657,"Love all the features the Iphone had to offer but I really don't care for how laggy the phone is. The 3G network your working makes it's hard to browse the internet, I don't even bother using my phone sometimes to look something up!"
9658,Love my iPhone! Can't live without! I have a 5c now and can't wait to get the 6. But I don't see spending the cash when my current phone works well. 
9659,I used to have this phone. I put it through hell and back and it lasted me forever. 
9660,I  hate it! it broke with a super good case on the screen is terrible and i strongly regret bying it 
9661,"Loved this phone! I used it down to its last breath! iPhones are fast, reliable and chic. There's no other phone like it. I love the white and that everything can be backed up onto iCloud!"
9662,"This was the first iPhone I purchased. I had it for about 3 1/2 years and it lasted through anything. These phones are built tough!! I have 2 little kids that dropped (and even threw a couple times) and my iPhone 4S didn't crack at all until the very end. Great features, great reception, great camera. I loved it! I just got the new iPhone 6 a few months ago and love it too! :)"
9663,"Not the happiest with my I-Phone, It has had to replaced once only after about 3 months of use and then the new one I got acts up from time to time. Sometimes losing pictures or text. Apple has improved on the phone but the prices are a bit too high "
9664,I had this phone before I got my 5S and it held up very well. I had it for over 3 years 
9665,"I did not like the iPhone. I think it takes quite a while to learn how to use, and even after 2 years, I still was learning new things. The phone sticks a lot, and since there is literally only one button, you get stuck on a frozen screen a lot. My iPhone called people randomly by voice recognition, which was frightening and embarrassing. I had to hit it on the table to get it to stop, causing the screen to completely shatter. I would not repurchase. "
9666,"The iPhone 4 at the time seemed awesome, but now that I have updated and got an upgrade I'll never go back "
9667,I think this is the best iPhone. I had one for a very long time before getting the 6 and this one never cracked never had any problems. 
9668,"Yes, I'm still in the dark ages with my 4S, but at least it was an upgrade from my 4! I enjoy using my iPhone 4S - it functions well for me and meets my needs for phone calls, texting, browsing the web, Facebook, reading, and the occasional distracting game."
9669,I like this phone I'm thinking about upgrading to a nicer version but for now it okay its fast and thats enough for now
9670,Love love love! super fast! I love it! who doesn't use Apple anymore? you know? 
9671,SOn bought this and LOVES it! smaller than new ones.....works great! Very happy with this phone
9672,It stuck alot... and still good for just a  normal day use phone with no app working.  good to make call only.
9673,"Love this phone, wish I have gotten the 32, the 16 is not strong enough for my needs. Other than that I love my phone "
9674,Good phone fast processing for the time. Would recommend it for a teenager maybe!
9675,It's a good phone but I feel like every time I get the new iPhone they make a better one. 
9676,"Not sure if it was just a defect phone but everything was fine for a couple months,  then the phone just blacked out, brought it to a tech and they installed an upgraded ios then and it greyed out the wifi and since it's past the warranty period had to deal with no wifi or get a new phone. "
9677,"I have this phone, wish it had more memory in it. I have to delete my photos every now and then or I run out of memory and can't do anything on my phone."
9678,Great phone with storage and a wide variety of applications to use that are useful and great quality
9679,Classic phone with lasting durability. Still sturdy and can withstand damage. 
9680,I loved this phone when I didn't have it....but I think apple does things to there phones so you are constantly buying the new version
9681,I loved my IPhone when I got it. After 2 years of running g out of storage constantly  and having  to back up I have switched to Android. I will never go back! It is so much easier to use and love how I don't have to have a software downloaded to get in my account.
9682,"I purchased this for my significant other. I don't own one, but it seems pretty cool to play with hers. I still still favor Android. I feel as  though Apple products are very basic. They have to be jailbroken to be able to personalize, and that takes up tons of space. "
9683,"I love all of Apple products!! 110% I'm now a user of the 5s, hoping to be a 6s user within the next several months."
9684,It was good when it first came out but is very outdated now and cannot support the current apple operating system. It's smaller than the 5 and does not have a lot of memory. 
9685,My 4s has lasted for years. Very good phone. I am looking forward to upgrading to the 6S soon.
9686,"I went from this to an iPhone 6, this was a great phone at the time but it is out of date now...I like the new design and battery "
9687,It's an alright phone... Not the best like the 5 and 6 but it does your daily jobs that need to be done. it does get slow sometimes.
9688,I really loved this phone. I've had it for over 3 years and it's been everywhere with me. We've been through a lot together and I was genuinely sad when it was finally time to upgrade. 
9689,Maybe because it's old but it has a lot of glitches and will occasionally just stop working or stop showing messages and I'll need to restart it
9690,"I had to down grade when my 5c broke which was a really big bummer, but the 4s is great. Just smaller."
9691,"I had the iPhone 4s, I loved it while I had it. My husband had the white version and he actually just upgraded and it was because I made him!! He had the phone for 4 years!!! It was a fantastic phone."
9692,"My first Apple product, I was so proud. I have since had the gold 5S, and now the rose gold 6S. You cannot convince me to switch back to a non-Apple device."
9693,The iPhone 4S is my current phone and i really like it. You have a lot of freedom with this phone when it comes to adjusting it to your liking and what's best for you. This phone is pretty durable it hasn't cracked since I've had it and it looks nice as well.
9694,I would highly recommend this phone. I love apple products and now I have a samsung. I miss my iPhone. 
9695,It's fine. I have my new iPhone 5s so it's a lot bulkier than my current. The phone was my pride and joy lol.. Until my new one. It's a good sturdy phone for me anyway.
9696,The 4S was a great phone! I would recommend using a case because iPhones shatter pretty easily. I upgraded to the 5S because the 4S couldn't keep up with the new iOS updates. Overall a great phone. 
9697,"This is a great phone but if  you are the type of person who needs a lot of space in your phone for a cheaper price, I recommend you stay away from apple because there are tons of android phones that allow you to use an sd card for more space. Overall the design and apps are very elegant and simple to use."
9698,Great phone! Apple keeps their software simple and easy. Only issue is I have is the battery doesn't last long.
9699,I loved my 4s almost as much as I love my 5s. My only issue with Apple is the amount of space. But I did only buy a 16 gig. 
9700,I do not like the iphone very much. it seems that it never gets any service.  The camera is good and so is talking and texting. 
9701,"Very cool, I love all the apple products. Awesome apps, it doesn't get slow, it doesn't get viruses."
9702,With every update the battery gets worse. that way you can go buy another one. samsungs are faster. this only gets 2 stars because of the hd video.
9703,Love my phone. its super fast and has enough space that i could download so many apps too.
9704,I received this phone as a gift for my 9 year anniversary . I don't see a major difference from the iPhone 5. The pictures move but only for a seconed while you are swiping through. I would only recommend this phone if you don't already have a iPhone. 
9705,I had this phone for 2 years an finally upgrades to a 6s i love the s series always comes out with the best features
9706,Personally not an iPhone type of person but it does what it needs to do for a phone.
9707,Apple iphone and computer are perfect for me for my applications and is good for me really
9708,I really loved it when I had it but within time it started gng super slow I wasn't liking that. I had to keep deleting apps and pictures video and music 
9709,"Iphone 4s has very little storage, i have about 4 apps and thats about as much as i can get. cant wait to get a new phone"
9710,I've had the iPhone since the beginning and the 4s is one of my absolute favorite iPhones
9711,"Great phone!! I love my iPhone and it works amazing, I can text and talk to my friends quickly and watch movies!! "
9712,"I love apple products and how they are so intuitive for users. I have apple phones, iPads  and laptops ! I would have given five stars but all of them have broken screens and I feel this is a problem consumers shouldn't have to pay out the nose for . "
9713,I love my iPhone 4s and it has lasted me a long time. I have the white and rose gold one and it is so pretty! 
9714,"The 4s is old and outdated. They run slow, small, and not compatible with a lot of the updates. Update to a 5 or 6. "
9715,Very user friendly. This is older so it can't do as much as a newer one but still a great phone 
9716,"I loved mine, easy to use, took great pics, easy to download and locate music.  I miss it, I will be going back to iPhone on my next phone purchase."
9717,"IPhone 4S is what I currently use and I love it, but I do plan on upgrading in the new year to the iPhone 6 :)"
9718,"I HAD this phone, but have since upgraded. Loved it when it first came out. Sleek and stylish"
9719,We have 3 in total with the family love them and very easy to use. Best cell phone ever
9720,"Had to have this  phone,its so smart and fast,so it makes me look that way too"
9721,I don't really like iphones anymore die to the fact they brake a lot and the batteries can completley die. 
9722,"Not bad for having an iphone but I hate how the screen not last long. Brought two iphone 4s and both are broken by same: black screen. I just have bad luck, i guess. "
9723,My mom has this phone and the camera is way better than the 4. Plus hers is still working after a few years when my IPhone 4 crashed after 1.
9724,"You can video chat, multiple group text or single, download from Apple Store, you can watch stream movies or show."
9725,This iphone is still great condition despite the newer iphones. If you have enough storage to get the newest software then this works just as well.
9726,"I rather get a android the phone camera is only good outside, it freezes I never had a phone that froze an d the fact that is glass and smooth makes it easy to drop. this evil yes this phone is complete disaster "
9727,This was my first iPhone. It was an amazing device!! I have upgraded since to the 5s and now the 6s but I love the iPhones!
9728,"Apple iPhones are my favorite. After I bought my first one, I knew I wouldn't be changing to a different phone. I love the clear camera, and it also loads apps quickly."
9729,"I loved my 4s. I had it from 2011 until Fall 2015.
Let me tell you this thing was pretty much indestructible for me lol. I dropped it countless times with no case and it didn't crack. I guess finally after years of dropping it caught up with my phone and the screen just shattered this past fall from falling off my kitchen counter onto hardwood floor. I just recently upgraded to 6s and it is not a thick as 4s"
9730,This phone was a champ for me. Lasted me 3 years until I turned it in for my new phone two months ago. 
9731,"My son has this phone personal I think it's soo very small,And can easily  break plus u have to pay for a lot of aps,But he like it's but he's a child and I know this phone isn't worth the money"
9732,I already had a iPhone 4s and it works good and now i just bought a cell phone for my son for school to get hold of me since crazy things are going on in this earth but yeah i can't wait to see his face once he opens it for chritsmas 
9733,Loved this phone ! Worked great not so small & not too big ! Screen size was perfect size . 
9734,I love My IPhone 4s I've been using IPhone for the last 6 years and I will always use them! They are dependable and I've never experienced and  technical problems with IPhones! 
9735,"Even with all of the new iphones coming out I still have this phone and I love it.. as long as I can update the software (which I can), I am happy to continue using it. "
9736,Can't go wrong with an Iphone 4s. I've had mine for 5 yeasrs and I can't kill it. Iphone will be my next phone when the one I have dies if ever
9737,"Have been using a 4S for over three years. No issues so far, can't believe the abuse its put up with. "
9738,Loved this phone! The only reason I stopped using it was because I broke it. It had all the features I needed and took great pictures! 
9739,Love the size it's small but not really big. Love the color and is very safe for me to use.
9740,This was a great phone. I never had any problems with it. I recently got an iPhone 6 and have had numerous issues
9741,"I love Apple products and my Iphone, I love so much, but I'm ready to upgrade to the Iphone 6s Rose Gold."
9742,I love my Apple iPhone! I have had the iPhone since they first came out. I love that it is basically a mini computer that I can make phone calls from. It makes life so much easier when trying to get things done on the go. I can not wait until I can upgrade to the 6s! I highly recommend this product as well as all of Apples products. I also love that you can sync all of your products together.
9743,Good phone for someone who doesn't do a whole lot. I've been back and forth between iOS and Android. iOS is good if you want a controlled environment where you can make very minor changes. 
9744,These phones are kinda annoying and the bad thing is when that one button that runs everything breaks you are in trouble
9745,I was late in the game getting a smartphone but I'm so glad I finally made the switch. The Apple iPhones are by far the easiest to learn and use. They are straight forward and simple to understand which I really needed!
9746,Had this so long ago but it was amazing as all iPhones are. iPhone is really the only decent choice for a smartphone in my opinion. So user friendly. And Apple is always there to fix anything. 
9747,"Mi teléfono ha sido de las mejores inversiones ! Su capacidad de memoria es amplia , el color blanco en iPhone es perfecto "
9748,"I'm supposed to be upgrading my phone to the next iPhone model, but with the experience I have with the one I have it's just hard to let go. "
9749,Loved my 4S! Worked great until ios8 came out and crashed it. Had no issues with it until then!
9750,I had this phone for over 3 years and to this day it never has given me a problem 
9751,I love Apple. I have had an iPhone for several years and don't think I would ever use any other phone now
9752,"Good camera (at the time), very user friendly 'idiot-proof'. starting to lag, especially with all the new updates, so I'm just withholding myself from updating anything unless i really have to. otherwise, decent phone, but the battery life sucks.."
9753,I got this a little while back and i just love it! i actually switched to a 5s but the screen broke with in the frist few months so i went back to my faithful 4.
9754,Great phone but I have had a few issues with this one that I didn't with the 4s
9755,Works like a mini computer. Used for years and never had a complaint. Took good photos. 
9756,When I first got it I love it but after 2 years it was slow and all my app kept closing and then my speakers stop working 
9757,Great phone with great features. Has a cool camera and so many awesome features. Suri is awesome
9758,The 4s is starting to get out of date since there are so many new and improved i phones out now.
9759,"I like my iPhone, it works well & it has lasted me a long time. I would like to upgrade to a new iPhone soon but my 4S is still working great for right now."
9760,"Had this phone for 3years and it work perfect, now it is my sister who uses it and it still works fine."
9761,"I am not a big fan of Apple. The only reason I have it is, I want to listen to my podcasts and all of my information is already on the iCloud. "
9762,"I had this phone for about a year and a half. It worked really well, but now it's so small compared to the 5 or the 6"
9763,Phone worked great for a few years but then it got really slow and stopped working as well.
9764,I could not figure this phone out. And i am no fan of not having a back button to use on moment  notice. It was not a phone i would purchase  again. Also storage  was horrible after the first week i had it!
9765,I actually have the iphone5s now but I have to say I love my iPhone's!!!!! I recommend it because I use it each and everyday and don't have any problems with it! Love it.
9766,It's a great phone to consider if you're looking into the refurbished phone market. It lasts for a while without issues.
9767,I really liked it when I had it. Runs smooth. I had very few problems with it. I just like LG phones better.
9768,"Good phone, BUT, by now it's not worth it, because newer updates to apps, like Snapchat, don't work on the older phones like this one. Technology moves so fast, get an iPhone 5 or above, this will be obsolete soon. "
9769,"I still have my good old trust reliable iPhone 4s.It does just about everything the 5,5s.6,6+,6s does."
9770,I love this phone so much I still have and use it to play games its doesn't really stay charged for a long time and that's only because it's so old I've had it for awhile but over all love it
9771,"I had this phone for a year before I upgraded to 5s. I had no issues with it when I had it. I never cared for siri. My screen only got a crack in it once I hit a bag contained with it and a few bottles of liquor against a concrete wall but other than that, no blemishes. "
9772,This was my first Apple product and it was good a little small but it was very useful.
9773,"I had this phone for literally almost 5 years, still worked great & I never had ANY issues out of it!"
9774,"I had the 4s few years back and it did the job, didn't ever fail on me. Apple products are usually very reliable and don't disappoint "
9775,"I had this phone for about two years before it died randomly. It wasn't bad. It was very, very slow, but usable. The lock button broke when I'd had it for about ten months. Despite being slow and freezing up somewhat often, it was a good phone and lasted me longer than any other phone I had."
9776,I loved my 4S. Once the updates started getting larger it started to slow down. It was also much easier to shatter. I cracked the front AND the back of mine. 
9777,Great product!! I couldn't love it better. really quality product for what I've seen! 😊
9778,I am using this phone right now. I use it for pictures and all kinds of other things. Could definitely use a separate back button
9779,Me encanta! es mi amigo fiel! se me ha caido muchisimas veces y todavia esta como nuevo! una de las mejores creaciones es de la apple! aunque su camara frontal deja mucho que desear pero de resto es perfecto!
9780,I used to have this phone. I loved it. I dobt have it anymore because I upgraded but worth the money
9781,"Absolutely loved my iphone. simple, and fun to use. only downfall is how fragile it is! I advise a good case and screen protector! "
9782,Its ok... only ok! I hate how small the screen is and the camera is aweful! If you love taking photos don't get this. Speakers are not very loud either.
9783,Out of all my phones I have had. This one was my favorite & I currently own a iPhone 6 plus. With the iPhone 4s I never had any internet connections fail. And it held battery life great. 
9784,I'm not going to lie I'm still using the iPhone 4s right now haha but anyways it's a excellent phone to have all the apps and stuff it' has is just great since I'm still in school I use the alarm to wake me up which is great and social wise it's great but pictures not so much quality but other then that it's a great phone #teamIphone
9785,"I love my iPhone. I used to have a Samsung Galaxy before I switched, and I like this phone so much more. Easy to use, love the iOS, it's fast, and has a really good camera quality. The screen is a little smaller, but it's still a great phone."
9786,I passed my 4s to my little cousin and it still is in great condition. Apple didn't go wrong with this one
9787,Used to have this phone and it wasn't very good.. The screen is very small and not the best quality
9788,"En mi opinión humilde, apple innovo hasta el iPhone 4s. Para mí, es el mejor dispositivo móvil de todos. Soy fanática empedernida de Apple y los he tenido todos (los iphones) pero en definitiva amo y me quedo con el iPhone 4s. La batería dura aproximadamente  1 o 2 días sin usar aplicaciones sólo mensajes de texto y llamadas. Nunca se queda pegado y es muy rápido incluso con la memoria casi al borde. Además, los diseños de forros para el iPhone 4s son espectaculares e incluso hoy en día se consigue mucha variedad; sinónimo de que el iPhone 4s aún no ha muerto ;) "
9789,"I used to want a iphone, but after i seen so many people complain about the phone i opted for a Samsung.  I would recommend someone do their research before any purchase is made."
9790,"I miss my iphone so bad , its the best one i ever had :( i don't like the new ones id rather have this one"
9791,"I used this phone last year and I had no complaints about it. Although it breaks easily, that can be fixed with a good case. Very nice phone but the screen was too small for my taste so I switched to android. "
9792,This phone is a great phone for a person who is getting their first phone . It's user friendly and easy to use but the battery life sucks on this phone . And the iOS sucks as well . It's slow and too outdated . Can't wait till I'll be able to get an upgrade . Hopefully the iPhone 6 plus because of the iOS it's running on now I can't even download most of the apps that require iOS 8 and it's a big pain . The phone is slow and glitches sometimes and sometimes the screen gets stuck or it freezes when the screen rotates . It's just bad ... I'd recommend something else .
9793,"Still have my 4s even though it is No longer activated (due to upgrade!) Use it as extra Apple TV remote, web browser, TV watching and face time. It's a great phone. A oldie, but goodie!"
9794,"I have used this phone for such a long time now. It has been out for so long, there is already the iphone 6 and i still use this. The picture quality could be better and the phone could be faster but overall I haven't had any big issues with it."
9795,Honestly still holds up even though newer products are out i like the constant updates. But the battery life is crap 
9796,"Love this phone! I bought it last year and it actually works! It is very helpfull as well, since I am a blogger!! Love it!!!!"
9797,"A really good phone, very practical. I've had it for a long time ( for a phone ) and it doesn't act up at all, it's still working very well actually, and I'm not planning on changing it unless I have to."
9798,"This phone is okay, but it's outdated now. The battery is awful though! It dies so quick and is limited now."
9799,My iphone is the extension of my arm ; I did not leave at all. I is very practical because the do everything from arrange my schedule to buy or blogging . Quite simply: the best phone I've had a also has a lot storage space for photos and download applications . Mine is 32GB
9800,"I had the 4s and it worked really great! I never had any issues with it, was sturdy the operating system was good!"
9801,Pretty good phone cracks easily and not very durable. Somewhat out dated due to the newer versions but a cheaper way to get the same iPhone experience without spending the money 
9802,Loved the 4s when I had it. As do every iPhone I owned in the past and present. 
9803,I always had android phones until I broke it. So my step brother gave me his iPhone 4s at first I hated the phone but I slowly got used to it. I end having it for 3 years until I dropped in pool. It was perfect size and I like how the battery lasted on it 
9804,"- disclaimer: i only have a regular iPhone 4, but there was no item listed -
I've had an iPhone 4 for 3 years now. No Siri, just a plain old iPhone. So when I broke it, I was looking forward to a brand new one, but since it was insured, I simply got sent another iPhone 4. Ready to complain, I decided against it, simply because the iPhone 4 is pretty amazing. It's simple, without all of the knick-knacks the new iPhones come with. Sure, the camera isn't the best, but it gets the job done. This phone has treated me well, and will continue to until I scrap up the cash to get a new one."
9805,"Loved the iPhone 4s. It was great for everything! Awesome for communicating, games for when you are bored, just about anything you needed the iPhone 4s was helpful with."
9806,"Ve had this for a while now, and it's the type of product that is so amazing, once you own it, you can't imagine life without it. We all know this isn't just a smartphone. Screw everything I know about technology and engineering - this is magic."
9807,I had this phone for a while and it was okay at best. It did the same thing as the phone before it but with tiny tweaks. It was my last iPhone before I switched to Droid and I don't regret my decision to jump she at all. Iphones are so delicate that they're almost impractical.  
9808,If you are considering getting this phone please do. I got the iPhone 5s which is better however this is still an amazing phone.
9809,"Best phone I've had so far! Battery life is excellent, and lasts me throughout the day! Lighter than other iPhones and has Siri as well! Very durable! "
9810,I had my 4s for awhile and really liked it. There were some minor glitches once I had the phone for awhile but that's normal.
9811,"My mom has this phone and whenever my iPhone 5 dies, I use hers. Not a huge fan - while the software is easy to use, the phone itself is extremely slow and seems to get slower every day. She cannot wait to get an upgrade, and I don't blame her. "
9812,"I've had this for a while now, and it's the type of product that is so amazing, once you own it, you can't imagine life without it. We all know this isn't just a smartphone. Screw everything I know about technology and engineering - this is magic. And I don't hand out positive reviews very frequently, but this just goes above and beyond. My boyfriend has the next gen, but I'm too attached to this one to even consider switching yet.
"
9813,At first this phone was great but after awhile it just stopped working like it use to. Not to mention when ISO 8 came out it didn't even have enough memory to update itself!
9814,Love this phone it's amazing and really hard to break if it's in a case love the design and the way it runs. 
9815,"Great battery life, great phone big improvemnt from the iphone 4 but the new IOS 8 kills the battery life."
9816,"I like that I can have apps and the Internet but, it wasn't long before I got my phone that I started to notice some problems. My phones light won't shut off even when it's completely dead and it keeps logging me out of what I'm doing. I've shut my phone off for a whole day and it does the same thing. At one point it would contact people from my contact list and write text messages by itself. I like apple products I'm just going to see if an upgrade will work better."
9817,"I used to have this phone while it lasted, it was pretty decent. I was tempted to get the higher generation ones, but this one did a pretty decent job. One star less because my front facing camera was terrible! the pictures would turn out so orange and not clear."
9818,So long Iphone 4S.... after 3.5 yrs my 4S is on its way out. The phone is starting to run out of battery way too quickly and freeze up. I am impressed it has lasted this long. I would not recommend anyone buy this phone going forward as the Apps and other uses for the phone will not be compatible with the older Iphone 4 forever. This phone would however be cheap and available used online for someone who wants a basic phone and texting and doesn't care if facebook or IG still works. 
9819,"I used to use the IPhone 4s before I upgraded to the iPhone 6, and I loved the phone. It did all I needed it to do and I loved having Siri when most people at the time didn't. I ended up not using the Siri feature as much as I had anticipated which was a bit of extra money I paid to have the iPhone 4s over the regular IPhone 4. I still have it and plan to save it as a backup if anything were to happen to my current phone and also to use for browsing the Internet with wifi if needed. I do think it is great phone but obviously now it's considered to think and the screen to small. Yet it is always a great option for those who want an iPhone but are on s budget. "
9820,I love apple products so I upgrade when I can. I hAd a 4s and it was great! And then you upgrade for the better Verizon.
9821,"I had an iPhone 4s and frankly I am glad that I upgraded. If you can still find this at a good price, then it's worth it to buy. But the camera quality isn't as great as the new versions. The apps can be slow and they don't process as fast. While it's a good phone, the improvements made on this version are worth considering. "
9822,"Mine is only a year and a half old, but it's never let me down. Sometimes the apps are a little finicky, but it only lasts a couple seconds. "
9823,I had my 4s for about 2 years until I changed to the 5s. It was a great phone for as long as I had it. I wish I would have had more than a 16GB though. I like to take a lot of pictures and I ran out of storage fast
9824,I love my iphone 4s it is super easy too travel with and always up to date but the only issue is now that it has become older it has also become slower
9825,"I used my trusty 4s until i was finally able to upgrade to a 5s. I was one of the lucky few who managed not to shatter the screen into a million pieces. I loved the software, still do. This phone tuned me into a diehard iPhone fan for life."
9826,Loved my 4S dearly until IOS 8 came along and ruined most of its abilities- hopefully I'll get a new iPhone once they announce one this September:)
9827,I've had this phone for almost 2 years now and it's still going strong. The only complaint I have is over time the battery life has gone down but that's understandable. I've had android phones that wouldn't even last a year. I'll definitely continue to buy Apple. 
9828,My first iPhone and its great! So much better than an android phone. All positive reviews for this phone and battery life lasts approximately 1-2 days while using apps/ downloading/ mobile data. I don't think I would ever transition back to an android phone again
9829,Apple products never disappoint you they are reliable and good quality. my only complain is that when i dropped my phone and the corners chipped a bit. 
9830,This phone is so durable it's amazing.  My husband has had this phone for a couple of years know and the phone has never given him any trouble. My husband even uses it at work and he works in construction so the phone has gone through so many things but it's still lookso like new even though my husband has dropped it off 4 story highbuildings and into cement and so many other things I can't even believe it still works. I think it's a great phone. 
9831,"I loved my 4s before upgrading to the 5s. If it weren't for it having glitch problems and outdated programming, I would still be owning a 4s. I hope the 7 has original features as the 4s did!"
9832,It's an okay phone I feel like it crashes so fast and it's slower then the new phones maybe that's why it upgraded but not my favorite thing.
9833,"It is July 2015 and I still have my iPhone 4s, I bought it as soon as it came out and it still works great! I have had no problems with any of the up dates!"
9834,"I have all Apple Products and they are all synced with one another through iCloud. I have access to everything at my finger tips. I couldn't live without my 4S
"
9835,"It's a good phone, I've had mine for a year now, but it has a lot of issues. First of all, don't get talked into an 8gig of anything, it's nowhere near enough. Even with everything being on the cloud, I have had literally 0 storage many many many times. I have 3 apps, no music, and maybe 400 pictures on my phone, and have megabytes worth of storage on any given day. Because of that my apps close out, it freezes up, randomly turns off, and many other things because it just doesn't have storage. If I had more room on it, it would be a great phone and I wouldn't feel the need to upgrade. "
9836,"I used this phone, (white) for two years of my life and I enjoyed it for the first year. After that, I had problem after problem with it. Then I finally got to the point where the power/sleep button wouldn't work. It somehow got jammed. So, that is why I had to give it only three stars. And after the first year I was ready for something just a bit bigger. "
9837,I had this phone when it was new. the chargers broke very quickly and the phone was kinda slow
9838,"This is a great phone.. I've been an LG, BlackBerry, and Apple owner in the past but this phone has been the best so far."
9839,"I had this phone for almost two years before I upgraded and then passed this phone on yo my husband.  It's held up very well, as we always have kept it in a case.  "
9840,"Love my iphone! I don't know what I would do without it! I use it all day long, and there are so many great functions! I find it to be very intuitive!"
9841,"I've had my 4s for two years now and I'm only now about to finally trade in for a newer model (and only because someone accidentally knocked my phone down and completely shattered it!). I have absolutely loved my iPhone 4s. It is easy to use, has a good amount of storage (even on my 8g, it's taken me almost 2 years to start getting notifications that my memory is starting to get full), and it's been extremely reliable. I've dropped it a million times on every type of surface, and it's survived the falls a million times. It has a pretty good picture and video quality (given that technology in that area has improved greatly in the last couple of years so admittedly, it doesn't quite stack up to the brand new models) and the battery life isn't the best out there but regardless, the 4s is a great phone that holds it's own in the world of smartphones!"
9842,This I phone is more durable then the 5 I shattered the screen twice on the 5 and had the 4s twice as long. 
9843,"I'm used to my iPhone now, but I switched  1 1/2 years ago from Android and it took me a while to adjust.  I did have problems with the Apple.  The battery was horrible.  Died, and I got a new one.  Which died, 3 days later.  Apple DID fix the problem and gave me a third one, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.  I do like the ease of the operating system. "
9844,"I had this phone a few years ago. This was what started my oh my iPhone path because I'm been an avid iphone user since them. the iphone is simple to use and the layout is very easy to look at. Since the iClud has been introduced, it's gotten simpler to look at my documents and play my games across my iphone, mac, and ipad."
9845,"Out of all the iPhones, the 4s is still my favorite. I never had any issues with it, and has a much longer battery life than the newer iPhones."
9846,"I had my iPhone for 3 years, I loved it my only complaint is the battery life wasn't the best!"
9847,It's an older version but it's still a good phone is still buy one plus they are cheaper
9848,Had this phone for 2 years and I loved it. Only complaint would be things worked less smoothly after each iOS update
9849,"I use to have a android phone then I finally decided to get the iPhone 4S. This phone does it all! I love using FaceTime.
"
9850,"This was my first smartphone! It had some quirks and the screen was a bit small, but I loved it. I still have it and it works fine, so it's my backup phone!"
9851,"Have had my phone for almost three years and have never had any major problems with anything, even with the loads of pictures I take and the 500 plus songs that I have on mine! Been a totally awesome phone! "
9852,I have this phone I us to love it but I am ready for a new one it's slowing down and not using the camera to take pictures or record anything 
9853,My dad had a iPhone 4S and he loved it a lot.. It was pretty good and the iPhone has come a long way with it came out. 
9854,"I loved this phone and had no issue with it when it was functioning. I put a 99 cent case on it and it was never damaged. I have a 16 gig though, which is apparently not enough space for the new operating systems if you use and memory for pictures and apps. I have also had to replace it twice because it will start to short out when using apps that use more memory. That being said, I was happy with it when it worked. Just be sure to have insurance on it and you can swap it out easily."
9855,I had so many issues with this phone. It's a great phone but it just didn't work as well as it should. The battery life is horrible compared to an iPhone 6 or 6 plus.
9856,I have this phone for more than 2 years and it still works perfectly fine! I love my iphone! I am not ready to upgrade yet!
9857,Have this phone for 5 years love this phone is amazing and works at every way love being able to use this anywhere and everywhere not too big not too small perfect size
9858,"I had my iPhone 4s for a couple of years and loved it. I'm glad I never upgraded to the 5, I hated it. The pictures were awesome and I protected it with an otterbox - I drop things frequently - so it didn't crack until after I had broken the otter box. After that I switched to the HTC one m8 and have never looked back. Although I loved the 4s, it has nothing on the HTC one m8."
9859,"I've had my iPhone 4s for a couple of years now, and I have no complaints. I'm a huge believer in using things up until it can't be used anymore. This phone may be an older model, but it's kept up very well through the years that I've had it. It's sturdy enough to withstand the many times I've dropped it and have only sustained a small scratch on the side. The screen may a little small for bigger phone users, but I'm used to it and have no problems with it. All of the functions work and I can still do everything from check my email, surf the internet, and take pictures with it. Can't complain!"
9860,"I'll preface this review with the fact that this is my second iPhone and I'm already committed to Apple products. I have the Apple TV, 2 Mac books, and my wife has an iPhone too. 

That being said, the intergration is seemless. I have multiple TV station apps on my phone that I can simply mirror to the Apple TV and watch on my flat screen. Needless to say if I am out and about or traveling or work I don't have to miss a soccer game because I can stream on my phone. 

You need a big data plan if you aren't on wifi often, but this phone has features that I am still not utilizing. 

Great phone and  good battery life (unless you are live streaming HD surveillance video for more than 30 minutes). 

I scoffed at the thumb print feature when it came out but it really is nice."
9861,I had my 4s from the time it came out until the time the iPhone 6 plus came out. I loved that phone. I ended up crushing it while skiing. That was a sad day. 
9862,I have always been a Andriod user and this past year I decided to get the Iphone 4s because I had never had one and always heard good things from family members. I got mine and I have had nothing but problems with mine. When I am due for a upgrade I will not get an Iphone ever again. Too many problems. Not worth it!
9863,I do not like iphones the battery life is horrible. They are constantly having updates to fix the bugs but once you update it you get more bugs. Its slow after so many updates and the screen starts going out. I switched to android and got an s4 and I'm so glad i did! 
9864,I still have this phone and I wouldn't trade it for nothing. Small enough to fit in my pocket or hand and gets the job done. Never had any problem with it. 
9865,Had my 4s for three years before switching to the samsung. It worked great and was pretty durable with a basic case and screen protector on it. 
9866,I have had my 4s for a little over a year.. the only thing I don't like is that the battery life is horrible. I feel like I am always charging my phone. 
9867,Would probably love an android more but this one does its job so whatever. and this one is simple to use.
9868,I also got this phone when it came out. I loved it but now not so much. The battery life is horrible. It crashes quite a bit. I cant afford new phone right now
9869,"I got this phone when it came out. I loved it, no its not easy to use at first. The battery life was good. I disliked that there weren't a lot of apps to get. My phone started crashing and running really slow."
9870,I actually liked my iphone 4 better than my iphone 5! I like a smaller phone which it was and i didn't see a huge difference in the two!
9871,"I have been using this phone for almost 4 years and the battery is still durable for a normal use, i don't  find any flaws, considering with a 2-year contract they are now free, if i had no money for an expensive phone this would be my choice."
9872,I currently have this phone It works great has a good camera quality I don't like how it's small compared to the new models but hey a phone is a phone!
9873,Good phone just don't like how it restarts by itself at random times. Other then that i love my apple
9874,"A good phone Apple iPhone 4S is an improvement iPhone 4, keeping the original design, upgrade your hardware. It has the same 3.5-inch 640 x 960 pixel resolution, but inside it has a dual-core A5 processor that provides twice the speed. Besides its speed up to 14.4Mbps HSPA connectivity, incorporates an 8 megapixel camera with 1080p video capture and runs the renewed iOS 5."
9875,"Currently using it as an itouch for what I use it, it's perfect.  I play all of my games on this so as not to use the space on my phone."
9876,"I like the Iphone 4s, because it has the Apple quality, and it's a small size, i wish that apple could do new Iphones with smaller sizes"
9877,I love my iPhone 4s! I know they are trying to phase it out with all the NEW iPhones but honestly I don't have any plans of upgrading anytime soon. The 4s is perfect for all my needs. It has Siri and all the apps that I need.
9878,"Overall I am happy with my Iphone 4s. It performed well, was easy to use and was dependable. This is the 2nd Iphone I have had and I enjoy the features it has. "
9879,"Pretty slow as of now, but a lot nicer when it came out, with all the upgrades apple has done since this came out, it's now a thing of the past."
9880,I love my Iphone. It has all the apps i want and its easy to use and I like my small phone not too big.
9881,"This phone was a star when it first came out, but as of now, 2015, this phone is on the highest ranks of LAG! The system has been amazing slow. Signal, wifi, and battery life is just a thumbs down. I had the 16GB version, I would say this phone is satisfactory for just calling. "
9882,"Battery life sucks on my phone, but its durable, and can watch videos and what not perfectly"
9883,"This phone was great when I had it, every time I would drop it I'd have bad luck but didn't crack. I cracked my screen 2 years then I gave it to my daughter so she can watch shows and it's perfect for her. (not cracked anymore) It's very durable compared to the newer iPhones."
9884,My boyfriend has this phone and he's had it for the longest and it still looks brand new especially since he's dropped it over a million time and its never broken 
9885,It smaller and easy to use although the battery life is kind of short. I like how it is not as long as the recent ones that came out.
9886,This phone was simple and easy to use.  It was easy to connect to all Apple and non-Apple computers for music and photos.  
9887,It might be older but it is absolutely my favorite!! The durability is awesome!! I might even repurchase another one!!
9888,I absolutely loved my Iphone 4s. I never had any problems with it. It was indestructible! I just upgraded to get a bigger screen :)
9889,"Good phone, but a pretty old model... It's pretty thick compared to iPhone 6, and much older than it! However, it still works well, if you update it regularly"
9890,"I've had delt with this phone as I used to have one for about a year and a half. I would NOT recommend this phone unless you HAVE to get it. It is free now for a reason. This phone isn't terrible as it is a smartphone and can do virtually everything most new phones can do, but it's outdated, it's from 2011. I'd recommend going with an iPhone 5s or a 6. "
9891,"Oh where to start... the battery drained within an hour, ended up having to get portable external battery cases and tubes.  also, the phone would crash out of apps that came on the phone(ie: settings app) and just had issues. i am glad to have a new phone"
9892,I had this phone for three years and it was just perfect. I love the apples they are compatable with almost everything. Now ive upgraded to the iPhone 6+ and its just as good too.. 
9893,"I had this phone for a long time, but I love to take pictures and when I would go print them they would be very blurry, but on my phone they were fine. I switched to the Samsung, but Idk which I like better. I really like apple for other features and then Samsung for different ones. If they could make a hybrid I would be in heaven!"
9894,"I've had this phone for about two years, and it seems to be holding up. It works and has a user-friendly display. However, I've been incredibly disappointed with the storage space and battery life. I had to remove all of my music (I only had a few hours worth) just so that I could take a picture. And my phone is no longer speedy enough to fun most apps. I've noticed that Apple products are built to slow down and degrade so that you will buy the latest version - this phone is no exception. I won't be replacing it with another Apple product. "
9895,"This phone is very durable. I've had it for over two years, dropped it probably over a hundred times, and the screen has never cracked and it runs fine. I love the simplicity of the operating system. Sometimes I do wish it had other features that other phones have, like Widgets. Overall, this phone is sturdy and does it job well! "
9896,Was very iffy on whether or not to get an iphone but after I got it I love it. I had only experience with my iPod nano before. It was the only apple product I had used. I was unsure about apple for awhile but now I am glad with my choice. Great phone. Have had little problems with it.
9897,"I like the iphone 4S. I had it for 3 years and never had a problem with it. I dropped it many of times and nothing ever broke on it, even with just having a cheap case on it. I didn't like that every time it needed updated it took lots of data storage to do so though. It eventually ment that i had to delete stuff in order to update. Overall, i really liked it. Now that the iphone 6 is out now though, i have switched from being a iphone user to android again. I just don't think the new ones are built as good anymore. They seem like they would break easy."
9898,This was my first iphone model that i got. i had this phone for about 2 years until i was up for an upgrade and i never had a problem with it. did the job well and then some. very pleased. simple and easy to use with a great selection of apps.
9899,I had this phone for 3 years; upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy s2. The battery life is a LOT better & it's completely user friendly
9900,"I had this phone for four years and only had to trade it in once... Can't be upset with that! It got a little laggy at the end, but I assume it was just due to the kinds of apps I use were moving away from developing for 4s and focusing more time on later Apple iPhone models. The only issue I ever had with it was the camera. Man did upgrading to a 6 make a difference in my photographs!"
9901,"I've had my 4s for over three and a half years, and have been pretty happy with it. I've dropped it many times and it just barely cracked a few months ago. With all the new iOs updates it isn't working as well, but what can you expect."
9902,"The iPhone 4s was a great device during its time of launch and the few years after (I owned it for nearly three years). Due to the latest technological advances, the iPhone 4s is probably on its way out in terms of incompatibility with the newer iOS releases. The battery in the iPhone 4s is not powerful enough to withstand a powerful iOS system such as the current iOS 8. I gave my older sister the iPhone 4s after I bought myself the iPhone 6. It lasted her another good year and a half! "
9903,Small and useful device! it is although heavier than its newer models. but it is better than the basic iPhone 4. this is because it has 'siri' on the device which is very helpful in moments where you are busy doing something else
9904,"Loved my I phone 4s at first until updates came along . Not all updates coincide with 4s. It is running very slow and shuts off a lot. I still love my 4s but will prob need an upgrade, which I feel is the reasons for all new Apple phones, they eventually need to b upgraded"
9905,"I have had this phone for around 2 years now, and the batter life is definitely declining. It seems like iPhones do need to be replaced roughly every 2 years for proper functioning. In general, I really do like apple products though, and will most likely upgrade to a newer IPhone. "
9906,The 4s was a great phone and I know people that still use it! I think the size is better than the 5 and 6
9907,I love the iPhone 4s for the simple fact that you can block numbers that call you. They removed this function after the 4s and it is a shame. I use it a lot on unwanted spam calls...even after being put on the do not call list. I have had this phone since 2011 and I replaced it with the same instead of upgrading. My only complaint is that the camera quality on the new phones is much better. 
9908,"This was my first iPhone. I had been through many droids and was fed up with many issues that essentially bricked the phone. The 4S did everything it said it would and more, plus most issues can be fixed by restarting the phone. battery life was great, call quality great and it lasted 2 1/2 years which i haven't had since my first Kyocera in 2003. Great product."
9909,I had this phone for 2 years before upgrading to my iPhone 6. When I first got it it was really up to date and I fell in love but if you are wanting to have a phone for a long time this is not it. On top of that every iPhone cracks very easily and I went thru about 6 screens within 2 years. Keep the screens covered!!
9910,"I love this phone even though it is ""outdated"" as far as Apple products go. You can't upgrade anything, or the speed of the phone processing reduces. However, Apple products are made to last and I've had this phone for over 2 years now with no issues. "
9911,My sister has this phone and it really good overall except for when you update it and it starts moving slow
9912,My husband has this phone and I have noticed it has delay problems with text and pictures sending and receiving .
9913,It's a great phone. I've had mine going strong for a good 2 years. It has great quality and is cheaper than the newer iPhone's.  
9914,I hated my iPhone 4s. I have gone through 2 of them in fact. Neither one saved any information to my iCloud though it said it was connected. Just not a big apple fan anymore
9915,I had an iPhone 4s awhile ago. However it was a great phone. The camera quality was good and it had a great operating system. 
9916,"I had my 4S for two years. I had to charge it daily. Battery life was horrible. However, the newer iPhones are WAY better! I have the 6 plus now and I can go two days without charging!"
9917,"I had this phone for awhile, but soon enough it was out of date and was running slow with the new updates. So of course i upgraded to a newer iphone! love how easy it is to use"
9918,I love the iPhone 4s it has great apps and it takes awesome pics I don't still have it don't use it for a phone but for a iPod now but it is a great phone
9919,"It's a good cell phone, but the big problem is the battery that can hold to long and also the memory that can be full quickly. "
9920,"Its terrible, very slow and has a lot of odd conplications such as closing out of apps and shutting down randomly and dying when its at 50% and also losing battery percentage very fast like from 75% to 35%"
9921,"I had this phone for 3 years. Everything always worked and I never had a problem with it. If I could, I'd still have it today! "
9922,So I have this one now it's horrible make sure you get a newer model other than this p.o.s
9923,It was a great phone when it was new! However I would not recommend it now. Instead I would go with at least a 5s or a 6. When you do the software updates on the older phones like a 4s it can cause software issues. I have had almost every iPhone I love them but just would not go back that many generations for a new phone.
9924,I have this phone since a few weeks but I like it. Very easy to use even if the battery is not its best point !
9925,At first this phone was great to me but then it started having difficulties with volume and it always randomly closed apps out. 
9926,Currently I have the Iphone 4 but come September I will be upgrading to the Iphone 4s as long as it is either free or at a discounted price..
9927,I love my iPhone 4s so much I don't feel the need to get an upgrade to the iPhone 6. I has a cracked screen but it still does the job.
9928,I was an android user but then I switched to iphone. I bought a 4s. I love it. I'm still using it until I upgrade to a 5 or 6. It doesn't force close my apps all the time like my android use to. 
9929,"I still use the Apple 4s and have no issues with it, I just wish there was more space on it because it is too expensive to upgrade to the 5 or 6. "
9930,I was really a big Apple lover for the pass 6yrs but since now that I'm being forced to upgrade my phone because it just suddenly out of know where started to act up. This is really wack of Apple. Where did we go wrong lol.
9931,"My first smartphone and I loved it! i owned this phone for a year and a half before leaving it on top of my car (still miss it). The layout was amazing, and for the time it was released and I received it, the battery and speed was the best! It last all day. I went from this to a G2 after losing it and missed my iphone so much! I ended up trading it in for a iphone 6. The 4s might be a little outdated and be so much slower than today's phones, but definitely is worth the price if you can get it in new condition for under 80$"
9932,"My first iPhone was a 16GB 5, but had an internal antenna problem and was out of my warranty. I work for an Apple reseller now so I was able to get my antenna fixed fairly easily. Currently using an unlocked 4S while I travel abroad which is awesome for international travel. Totally recommend this phone for entry level users!"
9933,Ive had my 4s since it came out and to honest i had no desire to upgrade to the 5  OR the 6. I'm happy with the 4. I'm not the type of person who needs the newest thing so the 4s I'm totally gonna stick with it. the battery life is great and I've even spilled water on it AND dropped it in a mound of snow and its still kicking. love. 
9934,I had an iphone 4s before my 5s and I loved it just as much as my current phone. They are so easy to use!
9935,"I loved this phone when it first came out. It had a decent size screen, good battery life, and a great look!"
9936,"This product is very easy to use, it's good quality. The only thing is that the battery dies a little quicker."
9937,I still use my 4s and honestly haven't had many problems with it. I never did the big update on it so it's been working just fine for me.
9938,I had this phone last year before I upgraded to the iPhone 5s I loved it the only problem was that it didn't have the fingerprint on it.
9939,"Had my iPhone 4s for a couple years now and it still works! Battery life might be frustrating sometimes, but this phone gets the job done. This size and shape of this phone is also perfect!!!"
9940,"I've had my iPhone 4s for about a year and a half and the only real problem I have noticed is that the battery dies very quickly now. I am replacing it soon though, hoping that will help."
9941,I had a problem where my WiFi just stopped working it was the worst I couldn't do anything it was pretty much a paper weight 
9942,This phone starts to slow down pretty quick and the battery life follows.easy to use and all but iPhone phones are not made to last. 
9943,I love apple !! i am able to do so much with my iphone. its a great phone. i had one for many years. 
9944,"Great phone i love apple! ive had my iphone for about 2 years an i cant go to any other user, its team iphone!"
9945,Great phone! I had this phone for several years and just upgraded to the iphone6 love apple phones!
9946,Ios8 is great to this phone the simplicity makes the phone so such better from others iPhone is great small in hands great to use battery life is pretty decent 
9947,This phone is pretty good out of all the phones I've had. Granted though the battery life is shrinking as I move into the three year period I've had it.
9948,"I had a 4s for years, and loved it! After about 2 years my battery life decreased and my phone would often randomly close me out of apps. I eventually upgraded, but the 4s was great when I had it."
9949,"This product is great, and works really well, however the apple service for this product is crap.  The updates don't work, and because of this I cannot download any new apps!! Apple needs to stick by their products"
9950,This is the phone I bought when I decided to finally get a smart phone.  It is very user friendly.  I recommend it.
9951,When I first got this phone I was really excited especially with the whole talking part. It sure did look for places for me 
9952,Not a fan of this phone. Small screen and Siri is annoying. Very outdated compared with other options
9953,"Had it for 2 years, Siri feature is pretty awesome. Very durable, but outdated. If you can update to the iPhone 5s or 6."
9954,"Very slow, and if you don't have enough storage room on there you're pretty much screwed if you want to put music or anything on there. Other than that it's fine. "
9955,"I love the iPhone 4s! I've had it for over 2 years and there is not one scratch. I love this phone the best over all the iPhones because it is great quality, and isn't too thin."
9956,This phone was the best phone for its time. When It first came out it was the best and most popular Apple device (of course).  But now you're not able to get the recent software updates and the phone continually glitches (my mom currently has this phone)
9957,"The iPhone 4S was a great phone in it's day.  If you can afford a 6, go for the latest tech. If you can't - the iPhone 4S does most of what you need. Just be aware that Apple will gradually stop supporting it as new models come out. "
9958,"I have one a couple of years old now and the battery life totally sucks. It doesn't even last a day when I'm only using it occasionally. It's probably just something that happens with age though since I have friends who say the same thing about theirs. Other than that, it has been a great phone so far. If you have one though, try to avoid installing iOS 8 as it isn't all that compatible. I prefer the 4S over the new 6 and 6 Plus because of the size. The new ones are too big for me. "
9959,"I had my 4S for literally 3 years. When I finally decided to trade it in, I got a HUGE credit because it was in PERFECT condition. Not even a small scuff. It was one of the greatest little phones I have owned. "
9960,Its was a great phone with good phone quality but we all know its all about that iphone 6 plus though!!!!  
9961,Apple always has the best new thing. Good battery and works well buttons and all. I wish I could afford it but maybe someday
9962,"I've had my 4s for about 2 or 3 years now and it's still going strong. I do prefer this phone to the other current phones available (iphone 5, 6, 6+) because I like the size of it. However, the technology is a bit slow unfortunately due to all the recent updated software apple has. The phone is great and I hope to be able to continue using it until I no longer can! "
9963,"I'm still using an iPhone 4S. The only issues I've had with this phone are battery life and it will often close out programs unexpectedly. Other than that, I've been fairly pleased with this phone."
9964,I had this model and I loved it until the screen went completely black and I could no longer use it forcing me to purchase a new phone. I now have the 5s and love and it and plan to save for the 6+
9965,"I've had my Apple iPhone 4s for 3 years and i have had no problems with it. with all the newer iphones out, i don't feel the need to upgrade as the 4s still works great and i use it all the time!"
9966,I've been using this version of the iPhone for the past 3 years and I love it.  I have had no reason to upgrade because I am so happy with this one.
9967,I love my Iphone 4s. It's been great. The only thing I've noticed is that the battery life isn't lasting long and I don't use it much through out the day and I've only had this phone for 4 months. 
9968,Overall. Good phone for the amount of time I had it. The battery just died really quick.
9969,This was my last iPhone. Loved it but recently upgraded to the 6plus. My 4s handled great. Loved the ease of learning the iPhone. 
9970,When the phone first came out it was great.. after having the iPhone 5 and going back to the 4 ... it is a lot slower =/
9971,I had this phone for a very long time and it worked very well. my only problem was that the lock button broke
9972,"I had this phone for 4 years and it was great, I found that since it was so old the battery would die really fast, but it still worked really good. Probably didn't help that I would update it all the time, just couldn't handle it anymore"
9973,"I don't mind the phone at all. Only problem is that my battery is dying extremely fast now since it is an old iPhone. But it still works, which is great!"
9974,Ive had mine for a year and half. The sound is not the greatest for other people hearing you because after a while the phone will just start to get shitty. I love my iphone but i swear they were built only to last a year. If you have an iphone please get an otterbox thats the only reason mine has lasted this long without a crack in the screen
9975,My sister had this phone she had nothing but problems out of it.  It kept freezing up the eventually blew up
9976,"I wouldn't really recommend the iphone4 considering that I had this phone for two years , know I have an android and compared to the iphone4 it is way better. Trust me from a person that had that phone for a long time and to say that it an Android is better says a lot about this phone. "
9977,I had it for only a couple months when it began to run slow. Cant put too many apps or photos on this phone. It was a disappointing experiebce for my 1st iphone. I now have the Samsung Note edge and am much happier with it  
9978,I use to absolutely adore this phone however now that I have the iPhone 6 the screen is way too small for me.
9979,I love my iPhone its like having a computer in hand at all times! Wouldn't trade it for the world
9980,One of the best phones I've owned. Easy to use and great camera. I love how long the battery life was.
9981,Love my iPhone so simple to use and iMessage is great just the battery doesn't give its 5th star as it can't last a day
9982,"This is a great device from Apple, though the size was a bit small. Apple continues to improve and better their devices, while this is no iPhone 5/5S/6 it was an amazing device for it's time."
9983,"I love the size of the phone and build quality. Do not update it to the latest software, as you will see a significant drop in speed. Otherwise it is a great phone to have."
9984,"I've had my 4s for over two years and it is still going strong.  The only problem I have had with it is that recently it started shutting off when the batter power reaches 20%, 14%, or 5%, etc.  It is never at the same percentage when it chooses to shut down, and sometimes it will stay on until it gets to 1%, but it is never the same and so I can never predict when my phone will die.  But I just chalk that up to it being 2 years old and having wear and tear on the battery.  Still a great phone."
9985,"These screens shatter so easily, and the operating system is lame compared to the galaxy s 3."
9986,Very good phone but if you want to play a lot of games on it you might want to get more gigabytes.
9987,"I loved my iPhone 4S.  In fact, I loved it so much that I was reluctant to upgrade to the iPhone 5S, and ended up going back to my iPhone 4S after shattering the screen of my iPhone 5S without a warranty.  To be honest?  There wasn't much difference.  The iPhone 4S did everything that I wanted to do and was an excellent phone for the almost 3 years I used it.  I didn't like the design of the iPhone 4S at first because I was terrified of breaking the glass back (in addition to the front screen) but a security shield on the glass back and a padded iPhone case solved that problem for around $50.  The camera took clear photos, and I never had a problem with the phone itself.  When the iPhone 6 released, however, my iPhone 4S was in need of a new battery... so I did end up upgrading my phone.  Still, the iPhone 4S was one of the better iPhone models!"
9988,I love my iphone 4s. However it did shatter the back so i may have to upgrade early. The phone is so easy to use and its a nice size. if it had a non glass back id love it even more. 4\5 stars
9989,"A fantastic phone, I had mine for 2 and a half years before upgrading, does the job, good camera too!"
9990,"I've had this phone for years and it doesn't fail me. The battery is starting to go bad on it, but that's really expected from ANY phone and considering I've had this for four years, I'm okay with it"
9991,This is a great iPhone.  I had it for a few years.  I loved the 4s more than the 5 when it came out so I waited to the 6 before i upgraded.  It did use up the battery like crazy. 
9992,I loved my Iphone 4s. But it is a older version now so it is slow. The only complaint I had while using this phone was my power button breaking randomly.
9993,"Great product when the iphone 6 wasn't out, but now it is slower, so upgrading is someones best option"
9994,"Durable, useful, good size. I like that I am able to do so much on this phone. Email, texts, calls, edit videos, social media, play games, take photos and so much more. Ive never had any issues."
9995,I really enjoy this phone. It does exactly what a phone should do - let's me make and accept calls. It also let's me send text messages and emails. And the plus side my favorite asian drama watching apps are available on the ios platform which to me is a win! 
9996,I love apple but I got this phone and after updating a new iOS the wifi greyed out that you can't toggle it. I did everything but it didn't work! Got me frustrated... iPhone 5 came out and so I'm crazy but I bought it!
9997,"I love my iPhone 4s. I like how it's not super thin like the other phones and I tend to drop thin phones for some reason. Ive had it for 2 years and I have dropped it multiple times, without a case and it never cracked. Until a month ago haha but still love it."
9998,I've had this phone for almost 3 years now and it still works great! I haven't had any issues with it at all. I will definitely continue to buy Apple products.
9999,"I love my iPhone 4s, I wish they would stop making all the phones bigger, I've had it for 3 years and still going strong, I'm afraid fot the say when i have to upgrade."
10000,"I've had my iPhone 4s for the longest time still works like the day I first got it! Really love it! It's easy to use and hey 
I get to be part of the iPhone team! Aside from that though this is the original iPhone that started with Siri So that's a plus"
10001,"I live my iPhone! My only issue is the short battery life. The camera is good, and the size is perfect."
10002,"I love my iPhone! I'll never go back to Android. Apple is so high quality I love all of their products from the iPhone, to the MacBooks, to the iPods. "
10003,I really loved this iphone it was one of their best ones it fitted in pockets perfectly. it was just too heavy. i regret selling mine because it really was a good phone :)
10004,Great phone. I had a 4s before I upgraded to the 5s. I really liked the size of this phone. Perfect to fit into my pocket! 
10005,Apple iPhone 4s is okay for the picture quality battery does not last long and very easy to break
10006,"Still my favorite phone! Although by this point, I'm sure everyone without an Otterbox or LifeProof case on their phone has had to replace the screen at least once. I love the size, love that Siri was added to this phone, hate the huge new phones everyone is coming out with! "
10007,This phone was my first ever Apple product and I absolutely loved it! I now own so many other Apple products and I owe it all to the iPhone 4s. 
10008,I absolutely loved this phone. It was my favorite Apple phone that I had ever owned. Much better than the 5 or 5s. I would re-purchase this phone any day. The size was perfect. The quality screams Apple. This phone was the perfect Apple device.
10009,"This is by far my favorite phone. Easy to handle and manage. Lightweight, durable, and convinient to carry."
10010,Great phone! Tons of apps in every category. Easy to keep connected. Fits easily in my hands. Fast and responsive. After having it for 2.5 years the battery doesn't last long. It would be nice to have the ability to have the battery easily replaced.
10011,Best investment I made... I love my iPhone.. I would go crazy without it! <3
10012,"This is the best phone I have had ever. I was very reluctant to get it, but I totally love it now. "
10013,I bought this phone several months ago and love its performance. It is fast and easy to understand. I ve had droids in the past and always found them great at first them they would burn out. I have had no problems with this phone! I am glad I made the switch. Camera on this phone is reliable and clear. Phone doesn't freeze and need to be restarted!!!!!
10014,"I prefer PC for my desktop for customization, but iPhones are great for no fuss operation on the go! There's so many free apps!"
10015,I have to replace my old palm and the 4s was in line for my new phone list. the best investment ever
10016,"IPhone does it all.
I love all apple products, I had an iPhone 4. It was my world, unfortunately I had to sell it b/c I chose the wrong carrier and couldn't afford the bill. But I still use apple I currently use the iPad..but from when I did have my iPhone it was great. 
So many features.. Love the touchscreen.
Tons of apps. Overall just a great phone"
10017,"Absolutely love my iPhone 4S. It's glued to my hip 24/7. Whether its for school or work or just for fun, I can do almost everything on my phone."
10018,"When Sprint offered an iPhone 4 for free this last contract renewal I was like free why not. But since I have gotten it and used it I am hooked. Now I would not stand in line forever for a new one,but getting the last version is great! No bugs to fix and gives me everything I could want. Love the apps and picture taking capability!"
10019,This is by far the best phone I have ever had!great camera and tons of apps to choose from. 
10020,I use to have a android phone then I finally decided to get the iPhone 4S. This phone does it all! I love using FaceTime.
10021,"You don't really need to say much about the iPhone (in general - 3GS, 4G, 4S, now the 5). It is point blank the greatest smartphone out there. I think it works for every age also. It's not hard to get a hang of. If you do not have an iPhone, and you are deciding on whether to get one or not....get one. Because you won't regret it. "
10022,"For the longest time I was a android girl I loved my Droid and I still do (shh don't tell anyone) But I dropped my Droid in the toilet and was forced to get another one. I was wanting to buy an iPod and I was like this doesn't make sense to buy a new phone and iPod why not get an iPhone and that was the best decision I made. I love it!!! I love the apps market, FaceTime and able to be on the internet and phone at the same time.. You can't go wrong with iPhone 4S."
10023,I love the iphone its so amazing it does almost everything from amazing apps to siri.
10024,"I love apple iPhones, iPods, and iPads. I have an iPad and an iPhone I really want to get the 4s. I heard the 5 isn't as good."
10025,I never ever had a problem with my 4s! It was perfect and quite frankly relieving not having to get frustrated with something not working or fixing it. Amazing space for apps and really great camera. Good processors and great battery life! 
10026,"The iphone 4s is grade A. starting from the HD screen and the cool app of siri, apple will be popular throughout the years."
10027,I couldn't live without my iphone. I can do almost everything from it. Really just an all around great product.
10028,"I own an Iphone and let me tell you, I would die with out it! Its pretty much my life and you can do just about anything at the touch of your finger tips. The speed that it provided is very good. I never have any problems with my iphone. I have had blackberrys droids and HTCs and so far Iphone is by far the best and i think i will stick with it to see what they can invent in the future. I recommend iphones to anyone who does not have one!"
10029,It does everything! Great camera.
10030,Before purchasing the iPhone 4S I owned an android phone. The iPhone 4S is way better than the android. Texting is easier and simpler on the 4s on the android I was never able to spell what I wanted it always hit the wrong key. The pictures I take on my 4s are better than the ones I take with my camera. The apps are great the service is good everything about the IPhone is awesome. I love it and recommend it for everyone. Dot be fooled by Android Apples iPhones4S are the best.
10031,I love IPhones period. What really sells the IPhone 4s is Siri. For those that are lazy to text or google things Siri is amazing because you can speak and you does what you say. I personally am a awful texter I hate texting people back but with Siri I just tell her what to say and she sends the message for me. Not to mention if you're bored you'll get a good kick out of her ;).
10032,I've used droid phones in the past and had nothing but problems.  So this round I went Apple for the first time and glad I did because I have not looked back yet.  Apple is a keeper.
10033,"I can't say enough about my baby, I mean my phone :) it is absolutely awesome, fast  and dependable, definitely a must have for any blogger or you tuber "
10034,Best phone I've ever owned
10035,"Very user friendly, apps update 1 at a time or multiple, updates for phone are always to upgrade the technology yet aren't too often. They hold their value well and last forever. I like that you can customize which apps you use thus making the phone unique for you and very user friendly. App store has tons of apps and constantly adding more. you can get many different covers to customize the looks of your device and even get button covers to make it that much more unique. Apples technology and quality are always cutting edge/top of the line. you cant go wrong with an iphone! Ive owned both the iphone and android and even a windows phone NONE are as userfriendly and just all around as good of a product as the iphone. they hold their value well so you can resell it and upgrade later on if you would like!"
10036,It still lacks flash and the multitasking could be better but the screen is beautiful!
10037,I love my iPhone. Don't think I will ever leave Apple. I'm switching all my electronics to Apple.
10038,I can't see myself without my iPhone.  I started off with my first iPhone 4 last year and recently got as a gift the iPhone 4s and I'm loving everything....
10039,"I love my iPhone and since I have Verizon, my network is great."
10040,I love this phone so much! I used to get a new phone every year until I switched to this baby! Obsessed!
10041,I would not survive with this guy.... I love the new maps update too--we had to drive from LA to San Diego a few weeks ago and it was nice to play music in my car while siri guided us. Super smart investment!
10042,"I love everything about this phone except the volume control.  If you are a little hard of hearing, the volume for phone calls and voice messages is lacking."
10043,This is not bad..it's just like every other android just more expensive..
10044,"Best phone is the world, had the Droid & that phone is crap compared to the iphone 4s. Not even in the same balllpark."
10045,I love the iphone so much!! its great. this i my favorite phone. its really easy to use and i love the seri. 
10046,"I'm happy to have my music, phone, and variety of apps in one device. If you are a music lover like I am...I would recommend getting the highest GB because the phone can fill up fast."
10047,I love my iPhone this phone is everything. It has everything I need it fast
10048,Love my marc by marc Jacobs case!
10049,"I love any apple product, I've had my iphone 4s for a year and I'll never switch to an android again. "
10050,It took me a while to switch froma droid to and I phone but well worht the switch everything is sync I love that. I wish you could down load music apps that were free 
10051,With the update to the 4s when the 5 came out siri and the maps are much better!! love my iPhone and other iPhone users and emoji's are awesome!
10052,The best product does it all
10053,"I was solely a BlackBerry girl for a while, but after a year of having my iPhone 4S, I am so glad I switched. I wish I would have stayed with my other carrier because this thing runs through data like nobody's business, but it's worth it. "
10054,It really good i love it some much 
10055,"My Boyfriend has the iPhone 4s, it's a great phone! only thing he complains about is that you are not able to download music from apps, like you would from android."
10056,It does everything i need it to do
10057,"It's got everything I need. It always keeps me occupied. It's durable as well. I know many people crack their screens and stuff, but I've dropped my phone on its screen it's still fine. It does have little dinks in them, but I'm fine with that. "
10058,"I love my new phone because it literally helps me with everything. It's like my own baby. I also like that it has Siri on it. Also, it is light and I wish that everyone i the planet got this phone."
10059,My husband has the Iphone 4s and I have the regular Iphone 4. He loves his iphone 4s compared to his old android phone and I love mine compared to the old android phone we used to have and the earlier versions of Iphone. I have had all the generations. My husband likes Siri. My son does too. It's a neat little gadget. :) 
10060,I love my 4s. It helps me do so many things and I really wouldn't want any other phone. Very satisfied.
10061,Now that I own a iPhone. I don't think I will switch to another phone. I can do everything on here and love it. It took me a long time to upgrade but I am happy I did. They are making changes day by day and for the better. I have mine thru Verizon and I would not change that. 
10062,"Oh, My iPhone. I love it. I have no complaints, really. And I think, this was Steve Jobs last masterpiece. Siri is ok though. And the New OS has a new wholes, but as a piece of hardware, this phone is great! "
10063,I have recently become an apple geek within the last few years and i can honestly say i will NEVER have any other phone! the ease of use is incredible and the possibilities are endless!
10064,"I have had my iPhone 4s for about 6 months, never had one problem with it. I use Verizon as my carrier, I wouldn't even switch back to anything else at this point. Apple has won me over."
10065,"I love my iPhone 4s! It's the best phone I've ever owned, and it seems like there is nothing it can't do!"
10066,I think this phone is an amazing device. Working in retail I have always been asked iPhone or android and I have experienced both my honest opinion iPhone! Why? Well because I like the fact that the phone and the operating system is consistent as well as every 6 months we don't have to worry what the next big android is. I also like the fact that apple makes it product with quality the hardware in These devices are solid just compare any other phone. iPhone has taken over the blackberry world and is continuously progressing. Once a year we have excited iPhone users :)
10067,"I am in love with my iPhone 4s! I had the Droid for years and I am now obsessed with my iphone. The camera quality is brilliant, I love the front ad face, it's fast, it holds all of my music, Siri is fantastic, etc. I could go on for ages! It is definitely a great buy and you will not regret it. This phone is practically my baby. "
10068,"Can't have a minute without my iphone with me, i loveeeee it <3 ! you can do everything you want! "
10069,"I currently have an Iphone 4s. This is my second smart phone coming from a very crappy droid eris. There are tons of great apps, even the free ones are good. However it was an expensive buy and is an expensive upkeep for the monthly service but there's really nothing you can do about that. Anyways this phone functions very smoothly and hardly needs to be restarted. Sometimes I do feel my battery doesn't last very long but I do watch a lot of videos so it probably would last longer if I didn't. Overall I really do love my phone and don't know what I would do without it."
10070,"To be honest, these cases are so cute and adorable I love them!!"
10071,Has many useful features and helps with everyday things. 
10072,"My daughter and I both had droids and she had been beggingg for an iphone and kept telling me that droids weren't any good. For her birthday I got her an iphone 4 and she loved it. She kept telling me to get one too. Every time I'd get mad at my droid she'd tell me to get an i-phone.  One day she had me use her camera to take a picture and the camera worked SO much better than any I'd had, I ordered myself a phone that night.  I've loved it!  I use the face time feature to talk to my long distance friend. We give each other ""tours"" of things and give instructional videos on crafts and cooking to each other.  Of course the apps are great.  It's so easy to use I over think it at times!  "
10073,"For those who are like me and switched from Android to Apple, great choice!

Simplistic, fast and efficient! Did I also mention Suri? Great phone for those that enjoy a dependable phone without all the constant glitches on an Android phone. There's also tons of apps from the iTunes store!"
10074,"I have the iPhone 4S and absolutely loveeeeerr it. It's does it all! Books, Games, recipes, Movies, Music, I can pay my bills and bank online!"
10075,If I didn't have my iPhone I wild be so lost. This phoneis actually a computer....it's extremely impressive. I have found that sometimes the phone can get a little slow if you download many apps and the screen can break if you are clumsy....but other than that this is really something that I cannot live without....a+
10076,Best phone ever! amazing quality and display! easy to use
10077,Loved this phone and am disappointed my carrier doesn't have it. Great size and shape and awesome picture quality. 
10078,"Everyone in my family has an apple porduct from an iphone, to iPod or an ipad. for the iphone 4s, i think its great. LOVE siri so much fun to play around with and use"
10079,"I have iphone 4s with sprint and its very slow sometimes. sometimes i prefer using my laptop or the tablet over the iphone justbecause they load faster for ,me."
10080,I think the i that the iphone 4s is a very good phone it holds a lot of memory in it.
10081,"Apple always steals the stage with their iphones. This iphone 4s is sleek, fast, light and amazing. it does everythign i need from my schedule to apps. By far my favorite smartphone of all time!"
10082,"Okay. I am writing this review from my phone. In fact, I always use Influenster from my phone. This little device literally does everything for me. It's amazing! I haven't had any problems with it. I think one of the only problems is that I am afraid to use the phone without my protective Otterbox Defender case. Otherwise, I absolutely love this! I would repurchase. Forever. "
10083,"I love my 4S! Best phone I've ever had! I've never had any issues with the battery, never really freezes or crashes on me, and it has the best selection of apps. That's actually the main reason I switched from android! It's also a lot cleaner and more organized than the android OS which is something I really love. Can't really go wrong with it unless your a man with big fingers, then the keyboard might frustrate you."
10084,"Very user friendly, apps update 1 at a time or multiple, updates for phone are always to upgrade the technology yet aren't too often. They hold their value well and last forever.

10085,"When I got this phone i had a Evo 3d on another line. I immediately favored the iPhone and soon after gave the Evo away. This phone is so cute, easy to use and does so much. And I love sharing everything with my iPod and iPad "
10086,I love this phone.. hands down! Good thing i switch from Samsung to Iphone
10087,"I often wonder how I lived without an IPhone before they existed.  I use the phone for everything!  It is fast and easy to use.  I check email, and facebook, quickly and easily.  The apps are great, and there really is an app for just about everything.  It is nice to have FaceTime to not only have free phone calls, but also be able to see people when talking to them, especially my husband when he has to travel.  Love my IPhone!!!"
10088,"I absolutely love my iPhone. I have had both a Blackberry and an Android and I will never go back. The iPhone is so customizable, user friendly, and I pretty much have my life on it. The only thing I don't like about the iPhone is it can be hard to really get into the workings of the phone and edit the settings. I think this is to keep it user friendly and keep people from mucking up the settings, but I am pretty tech-y. "
10089,This phone is to die for. The FaceTime comes in handy. Keep going apple
10090,"I HAD THIS PHONE & I WAS SO IN LOVE WITH IT , I MEAN WHO WOULDN'T LOVE ANYTHING FROM APPLE "
10091,"I've always gone through phones super fast. I either didn't like them or they couldn't handle the wear and tear. I've had my iphone 4s for a year now and I haven't even looked at any other phone. It's great! I call it my personal assistant because I use it for school, calendar, grocery lists, reminders, getting directions, finding business reviews... the list goes on."
10092,I was resistant to getting a smart phone and my hubby talked me into one and i love this phone. 
10093,"I love this phone. It is easy to use, stupid proof essentially. We are a family of iPhones and my brothers and I love the technology packed into the little hand held device. My parents, despite being technologically impaired, caught on really fast. Normally with new phones there is a long ""How do you do...?"" period, but with these they managed to jump right in "
10094,"I love my iphone,I used to be a blackberry girl and can't believe I waited so long to have a iphone and all the stuff I was missing out on. Great apps,it makes life a lot easier and all at my fingertips."
10095,"
I love my iPhone 4S!!!"
10096,"I have had this phone since thanksgiving of 11 this phone has went through so much such as dropping it in water, mashpotatoes, more water shea butter and more water and it still works just fine ive gt a crack or two on the sides nothing big or on the screen and the worst that happens to it is when it gets wet the speakers get foggy till its dried."
10097,"I had a sidekick lx for the longest time. When I finally got around to getting a ""real"" phone, iPhone 4 was the first one on my list. Love this phone. I'm completely comfortable with it!"
10098,I switched over from blackberry and I've been happy ever since. I love the iPhone 4S. It does it all. Don't know what I would do without it!
10099,"I love the 4S, I love the better camera and how fast it is compared to the 3G that I had before this phone. "
10100,"I am definitely an iPhone junkie. I went from having a Motorola Razr to having the first iPhone, I was hooked. "
10101,"The iPhone 4S was my very first smartphone. In all honesty, I HATED the idea of going from my cheap, basic phone, to an expensive smartphone. At first, I tried to get the phone without internet and data, everything that I had to pay extra for. Of course they said that it was not possible so I decided on the iPhone. I figured that if I was making the change, go big or go home. Anyways, I couldn't be happier with my phone now. I can't imagine what it would be like without it. Now I can look up any number I need to on the internet without a computer. The applications are great too. My school even has their own app so I can check my grades whenever I need to. The only thing is to make sure that you have a good case that covers the entire phone. If you drop it and it hits the right spot to where your screen shatters, it will feel like you lost everything. "
10102,I really don't know how I ever managed without my iphone. I've seen other smartphones and I just love Apple's functionality. I'm a bit of a fangirl!
10103,"Love it.. I can do all my work from my Iphone anywhere , anytime!!!"
10104,"I love my I phone!!! I'm on it more than I'm on a computer! And I've never had a problem with it being fragile, but then again I've had it in an otter box for as long as I've had it. It's a really great phone and since I have sprint, I get unlimited Internet!!! "
10105,I've had this phone for a month now and I love it...way better than the Blackberry I had...the iPhone 4S does EVERYTHING!!! I love it :D
10106,Once you go apple you can never go back. I love my iphone I can never leave it alone. I use it more then a computer. :) TEAM APPLIE!!!!!!!
10107,I absolutely love Iphones and this one is no different it is just as great
10108,Just had my iphone 4s for a little over 2 months now. It's amazing works really well easy access to just about anything right in the palm of your hands
10109,I don't have one anymore but the i phone is just great :) and the picture quality is just amazing <3 i would so recommend it to anyone :))
10110,Best phone I ever had. I was loyal to blackberry until 4 months ago. I love my iPhone. Powerful and does everything I need and more!
10111,It is by far the best phone I've ever had and it is so handy! it does t all!
10112,"My son loves his iPhone 4s. It's very practical, fun and user friendly. I, personally prefer a different type, but I can totally see why people love it. "
10113,"Apple never disappoints me. I have an iPod and my iPhone now searching for the iPad. I love apple products, just don't like that one computer per product "
10114,"LOVE IT.
I currently use my moms phone ( IPhone 3) and have been dieing for the phone. All apps, games, SIRI is great! I even love the adorable cases you can buy! "
10115,When i got this phone at first i was a little bit scared because i thought it would break or something but then when i turned it on i didn't turn ii off that is such an amazing phone !
10116,"Better than the Blackberry Torch 9800 I had.
Not slow. Lots of iPhone cover selections. Siri is helpful at times. Lots of apps available for download"
10117,"I love, love, love my iPhone 4S. I just love apple in general. The phone is so easy to maneuver and figure out. It doesn't take hours reading and owners manual to understand everything the phone does. Siri is fabulous and very handy when you are constantly on the go with little time to send a text. I love the front  facing camera, so I know what I look like before I take a picture! And it is a lot to get a good picture when you are taking one of yourself and others. The regular camera is so much better on this phone than any of the others. The image is so clear and consistent. It takes photos that look like they are in high definition. The browsing speed on this phone is also much better! As soon as you press ""go"" the sites pop up! Dropped calls are a rarity now with the improved antenna! 

This phone is definitely a must have:) Love it!"
10118,I love Apple Products ! I have a Iphone 4s and a ipad ! Does it all ! 
10119,Love my iPhone.  It does so much...more than I had ever imagined.  Very easy to operate and didn't take a manual to begin using it right out of the box.  I've had mine for about two years now and couldn't be happier.
10120,I have used all of the iPhones and I can honestly say this is the best and most innovative phone ever. Even the iPhone 5 can easily be said to be worse than this phone because it is barely modified and still has the iPhone 4s in it. There's not much that can be changed from the iPhone 4s to make it a much better phone and is one of the best phones in the market. 
10121,"Oh how I love apple products, haha.

I especially love my iPhone 4a though. The screen is HUGE and yet the phone is still an amazing comfortable size. I have saved my bottom from being lost and stranded TONS of times with Apple Maps and navigation (ty apple!) The camera is amazing and I love the games and connections with my other Apple Fan friends. Can't wait to see what they do next!"
10122,"The I phone is something that seem like a staple in the American house hold. It does games, self help, makes calls. If you think of something that you wish this phone did there is probably an app for it. I can share photos when ever or where ever I want and send them to family members who don't get to be near. "
10123,"I've had my iPhone 4S for around 10 months now and I love it. Sure, there's a new guy in town, but I'm perfectly satisfied with what I've got."
10124,It's an awesome phone can't do everything and never acts up. So they say... I have had 3-4 iPhones and they all gave me nothing but issues. N apple is getting crazy with charging prices on apps. 
10125,"I've had my 4S for just under a year now and I LOVE it, no cracks scratches or anything and I don't even take special care of it. It's much faster than the first touchscreen devices apple put out so they are doing a great job improving. I find iphones very easy to use and they get everything done :)"
10126,My phone has my entire life on it. Love Apple products. Always reliable!
10127,This phone is such an awesome phone and it is just as good as the iPhone 5s and you can get this phone for free on Verizon's website!
10128,I went from a blackberry to iPhone and honestly can never go back. Yes apple has a few problems here and there but no phone is ever truly perfect. The downfall is having  to go to an apple store if you’re having any problems with your phone and the closet one to me is 45 minutes away. Also apple care I have it but I think it sucks that you have to pay an additional charge if you crack your phone on top of the $99 you pay to have apple care. I have yet to crack my phone but have heard the horror stories. I love my iPhone and wouldn’t have it any other way. 
10129,Nicely easy
10130,Before the iPhone 4S I had a flip phone so I made a major upgrade with this phone 
10131,I absolutely love my iphone. This little thing does a ton of things for me which is great. I don't thing I'll be upgrading to the iPhone 5 anytime soon as it pretty much does the same thing.
10132,I don't need no extra inches of screen length .I love my phone just the way it is.I like everything about it ! 
10133,I LOVE my iPhone 4s especially with the iOS 6.1 update.  I can do almost everything the iPhone 5 can do without having to switch anything over. 
10134,Iphone 4s is basically like iphone 5 just smaller and much more compact is u wish to have a huge phone u might as well buy a tablet 
10135,"I love this phone . I have it for almost a year and it has been an amazing phone . It's my frist ipone and I am in love with it . I love the games , the camera & the cases for the phones are cute to . I would rebuy it if something went wrong with it . <3
"
10136,"I love my Iphone, it literally has an app for everything. I love the sleek design where there is no access to the battery."
10137,Upgraded from an android phone that lagged constantly to my iphone 4s that runs smooth and lets me do everything i need to do quickly and problem free
10138,Love my 4s.
10139,"The IPhone does it all. I absoultely adore my IPhone 4s, and couldn't imagine my busy life without it. It allows me to be connected with everything, whenever I need to be!"
10140,"Great phone to have especially compared to an Android. I'm not knocking the great and powerful microsoft software phone but when nothing goes right and you need something helpful, turn to the never-let-you-down phone: the iPhone. What makes this phone better than the others- 1,2,3,3gs, and 4- is Siri. She is every business-soccer mom-get up and go persons best friend. Besides the usual technical glitches that everyone phone comes with Siri helps with appointments, traffic, nearby movies and sports scores. If you are looking for an easy to use phone with never ending surprises, this is the phone for you! "
10141,I use my iphone for everything. I love it more than any Droid I had. I love the feature of the group chat because almost everyone in my family has an iPhone! I can do so much with it and I will always be team iPhone.
10142,I'll give the phone credit for being pretty much a mini computer but I find it boring.
10143,"This phone is good, but I find Siri goes downhill after you have the phone for a bit. Also the battery life is not the best!"
10144,I have been thur so many phones before from blackberry to android to windows phone and now Apple. i used to change my phone every 3-4 months just because i was bored with the phone. i can honestly say that with my iPhone its not like that at all. i been having this phone for over 6 months and I LOVE IT.
10145,Wish i had one
10146,"Firstly I must explain my background, I am not an iPhone user, but part of my family are. As the technology guru of my family, I set up all technology related items for my family. so needless to say I have a lot of hands on and experience with the iPhone 4s and 4.

The iPhone 4s is a GREAT smart phone. It has all of the capabilities as other smart phones, and all in a simplistic design. 

My qualm is that it is a little too simplistic, a 5 year old could figure it out. another downside to this device is that there is a lack of customization.

The iPhone 4s is a powerhouse of a phone, it has a great cpu and sufficient ram, making the experience extremely smooth. with the retina display this phone is beautiful, games look great on this phone.  

there is a plethora of apps on ios, but... most worthwhile apps are costly...

siri... is hit or miss... google now is much better. siri does have a sense of humor though.

botomline, it comes down to operating system, and preference. I prefer android to ios, but if you're looking for simple, go with the iPhone you won't regret it"
10147,"Fast as can be , i love new technology"
10148,It's the best phone :) cant leave the house without my phone
10149,I love the 4s because after the update to the IOS you don't have to be connected to wifi for FaceTime. It makes it easier for me to FaceTime my daughter when I am in an area that doesn't have wifi
10150,"I love apple products & this phone is no different! It's amazing! It's like having a mini computer in your pocket! It's so entertaining, there's always something new to stumble across. I don't think there's anything this phone can't do!!!"
10151,I love it. it does evrything 
10152,"I love my iphone, but Siri's abilities are seriously lacking on the 4s.  I thought it would be easy to ask Siri for information instead of typing everything, but it always takes longer to use Siri because it often gets the information wrong."
10153,"The 4s is definitely an upgrade from the 4. I switched my carrier and had to downgrade from a 4s to a 4, and I hate my 4. The 4s not only has Siri (whom I thought was annoying until I didn't have her), it is also much faster. Apps load quicker and the Internet is even faster. Once I got my 4s, I no longer had need for my computer. Like another reviewer said, it really DOES do it all!"
10154,"This iPhone would be great for 95% of the users and does everything needed. It is pretty fast, Siri is cool, and if you're used to Apple products, an overall good job. But the question is, is it that much better?

When Apple has chosen to place more stock in the build of the phone rather than the UI or screen size it is hard to argue against some of the other phones out there. I have owned ever iPhone ever made except the 5. Since the release of the 4, I believe we are at a point of diminishing returns.

For the next iPhone to change my mind (5S or 6 whatever they call it), they will have to do something drastic. Right now, I am looking at making the switch to Android....

Sincerely, former Apple fan boy"
10155,"I love my 4S. I have Sprint which sucks, but it is my work phone. The phone itself is a solid product. The only complaint I have is the battery life. I also have an Android and I can go all day without having to charge it. Hopefully the next iOS update can fix some of that"
10156,I love the iphone it does amaing things and you can find anything on it like weather where you are restraunts nearby. It also has great apps since I'm still in high school it has great apps for flash cards dragon speak and it has functions that help with homework!
10157,"I went from the first iPhone to this one, and I like the software improvements and better features, but I don't really use Siri much. "
10158,Love Apple Products! So simple to use! I recommend this for anyone. You will love it once you get one! 
10159,"I have an upgrade available but made the choice to keep my 4S rather than to upgrade to the 5. This phone does everything I need. Honestly, the 3S had the best body style (in my opinion) but this one is still great. I use my iPhone for everything! "
10160,"You just can't go wrong with an iPhone 4S. It just works right out of the box. It is very snappy. The camera is simply amazing. The amount of accessories that you can find for the device is off the charts. 

Just be sure you choose the right carrier for your needs. Sprint and Verizon can't do simultaneous data/voice."
10161,"The iPhone 4s is awesome! I had the iPhone 3, so upgrading to this one, it's like a world of difference. I love all the features and how easy it is to use. I'm an Apple fan forever. "
10162,"I have had the iPhone 4s for almost a year now. I got a 16gb refurbished and I am in love with it. I uses it as an iPod, a phone, a gaming device, and to watch movies. "
10163,"I love my iphone 4s!!! It is so convenient to have everything I need at the palm of my hands. Though sometimes my messages don't send, it could also be the network.  "
10164,I have had the iPhone 4S 64 GB for over a year. I love this phone it work great. The only down side is the Sprjnt Network.  :(
10165,I bought my phone in late April of this year and I absolutely love it!! I'm on my phone all day and my battery lasts a very very long time. Also it is very easy to navigate and overall the best phone I have ever owned.
10166,I love my iphone 4s. When I got the phone I was told that I wouldn't really like it. But now I have had my phone for almost 2 month's now and I love it. 
10167,"Recently switched from an Android Device to iPhone.  I waited FOREVER to get the iPhone and am so glad I finally have one!  The apps are better on iPhone and the functionality is better.  It's a bonus not having to restart my Droid every day to keep it from not crashing!  Though, I wish the Verizon iPhone had some of the capabilities of the AT&T iPhone"
10168,I love it with all of my heart
10169,"Recently switched from android to apple!  I love my iphone, definitely have less glitches, more apps, and the iphone also has cuter cases/ it's simpler to work with"
10170,I love my iPhone 4s. Had an android before getting into apple this year & i must say i wouldn't go back. Wouldn't even think about it for a sec..everything i want & need i have rite here with my iPhone. I just love it & its many apps
10171,"I love the iPhone, and in my opinion none of it's competitors have topped it. The only thing I wish it had differently would be something like blackberry messenger, but overall it's fast, useful and gorgeous"
10172,I currently have a Iphone 4s and I love it <3 It looks stylish and trendy The only thing I dislike is the battery life sucks >.< The battery can only last about 5 hours if you use it a lot like me for work 
10173,I'm glad I switched over. I've had zero problems its such a great phone.  I love syncing with my iPad and the cloud. 
10174,I was a blackberry user for years and came around late to the Iphone. What a fool I was! This phone has it all. I can multi-task like no other. Easy to use. 
10175,My husband pre ordered me this before they came out and I was really excited to get it! It is everything I hoped it would be! It comes in very handy if I need directions and I am driving because all I have to do is ask Siri and it takes me right to the location! I have used that countless numbers of times! It makes using the phone so much easier. If I want to know the score to my favorite football team all I have to do is ask! Another great feature is FaceTime and having the Skype app! When my husband was overseas I could only skype with him while I was at home. So when I got this phone I LOVED the fact I could see his face no matter where I was at! LOVE IT!
10176,"Nothing needed to say except that it is an awesome, user-friendly phone that does it all. "
10177,"This is legit the best phone i haveever owned, makes my life so much easier."
10178,I really didn't want to pay $200 for the iPhone 5. I also didn't want to buy a new car charger. I did want an upgrade from my current iPhone and I wanted to see how the Siri personal assistant worked. I am happy with my phone. I don't have  to have the newest of everything but I did want to at  least be current. I love my phone.
10179,"My dad has it and he is always talking about how great it is. He uses it for work so he can get his email, his sports apps, he can pretty much do anything on it. He says he absolutely loves it! The only thing he does not like is the battery life.
"
10180,"I love my iPhone 4S.  I've had it for almost one year now and have had no complaints.  I had a Blackberry before the iPhone and never seemed to get any signal when I traveled to Puerto Rico.  With the iPhone, I get signal in practically every part of Puerto Rico! I love it and wouldn't change it for any other.  "
10181,"I never really liked the idea of an iPhone until earlier this year. Once I got it, I fell in love! This is definitely my favorite phone of all those I've had. It does everything, and it's easy to use. "
10182,My life was transformed when i got my iphone 4s. I now can remember assignments for school because i can save them in my reminders and it will notify me about them. I also can stay in contact with all my friends on facebook and through text messaging. I just love my phone and would feel lost without it.
10183,I was an android lover for 4 years and at first isn't want to get an iPhone because everyone had one and didn't like the fact the screen was so Delicate. But my Samsung galaxy was disappointing so I decided to get a iPhone 4S and guess what I absolutely love it better then any android I've had. 
10184,"I will admit, I was a little worried about leaving my blackberry.  But once I got my IPhone, I never looked back.  It is super easy to navigate and I love the camera.  I love all the apps avaiable (something for everyone).  You can organize your apps to fit your family members: all games for child one in one block, games for child two in another.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this phone out.  I also love the idea that I can lock my phone if I was to loose it.  "
10185,"I've had my iPhone for a while now, and I love it. It does so much more than just a phone. I love that my phone can keep me entertained all day long. The only downfall is that the screen can crack pretty easily if it is dropped, therefore you should probably have a case on it."
10186,It literally does everything! Haters will hate hands down apple iPhone is the best phone ever! So easy to use & it's just the best
10187,I love my iPhone and have had it forever I had so many songs and episodes of podcasts unfortunately my computer broke and now I'm really upset that all my stuff is gone with no way to retrieve it :( but the phone was great up untill that
10188,"I was never an Apple lover, but I love my I phone!! I will never go back unless I have to!"
10189,ONE YOU GO APPLE IPHONE YOU GO APPLE EVERYTHING. THIS PHONE IS THE BEST THING THATS  EVER HAPPEN TO ME.
10190,"I switched to Iphone 2 years ago and I will never use another phone. I have never had any problems with my phone at all. Although, one must take in mind that the apps that are bought may not work correctly or that the phone is generally a computer. I have never had any problems with my iphone at all! It is very reliable and useful! I recommend that anyone who would like a smart phone to buy Iphone. "
10191,"I love the phone, BUT up to a certain point. I hate when it freezes. And when it won't flip the screen if I'm doing something. But it takes amazing pictures and when it is working perfect it runs smoothly.
Also its great with water believe it or not LOL, I dropped my iPhone in the water several times and still worked!
The speakers wouldn't work for up to 10 hours but after that it went back to normal!"
10192,I'm obsessed with my iPhone 4S. I honestly haven't loved any other phone more. 
10193,"I had the palm pre before this and I loved having a smart phone. I used it or everything! Unfortunately, they won't make new apps so I wanted to keep up with everyone and get the latest apps  so I got this phone and what can I say it's the best phone I ever had. I use it for everything! And I love getting to keep up with everyone!  "
10194,LOVE my iphone 4s. I don't know where i would be without my phone i do so many things with it from keeping up to date with my facebook friends to emailing and texting it is a number one recommended phone without a doubt. If u don't have one your missing out treat yourself to a phone that DOES iT ALL!!
10195,It does everything the other Iphones do. Nothing really special about it.
10196,"This is my first smartphone and I love it. I have played with others phones, but there is no comparison. Love having a device for music, apps, email, Internet, and phone capabilities. Plus Siri is so much fun, my friends and i love asking her random questions "
10197,"I went from a Nokia, to Blackberry, to Apple in the search for the perfect phone. i had stopped at ape because apple products are really meant to satisfy the consumer needs. The iPhone 4s is probably one of Apples greatest products out in the market. Its easy to use with minimum amount of buttons, touch screen, and mainly its user friendly. Another great feature is Siri, a personal assistant thats built into the 4s. Now Siri can do anything from tell you the score of the football game, to making a reminder, to setting alarms, and Siri can be quite funny too!! Overall I give the iPhone 4s a 5/5 and highly recommend this smartphone to anyone out there!"
10198,I Love All Apple Products They Realy are Top Of The Line!
10199,"I love my Iphone, I Can do anything and everything on it."
10200,LOVE MY IPHONE THEY WORK GREAT
10201,"I actually have an iPhone 4 but back when I had a #G and the iPhone 4's weren't out I had the Siri app and to be honest she isn't that useful. I know that now that it is part of the phone it's probably a lot better, but my sister has the 4s and she rarely uses Siri. i think that iPhone's are amazing but there is no need to get the iPhone 4s. iPhone 4's are just fine!"
10202,I was an Android user before getting the iPhone 4S. Will stick with Apple from now on!
10203,"I had the IPhone 3, and now the 4s. The IPhone is so convenient, it’s like having a phone and computer in your hand. There are a variety of apps from games, to social media, news… pretty much anything you can imagine. I’m not a fan of Siri because she doesn’t ever do what I ask. Also not a fan of apple maps because it has gotten me lost a couple times. Hopefully future updates will fix that. Overall, it’s a fun phone, just not a very good GPS."
10204,Great phone for business and for fun.
10205,Apple Iphones are the way to go!
10206,LOVE! Siri's my bestfriend (:
10207,I love the iphone its helps me with eveything . every time i need help with something i just ask suri and she helps me. this has helped me a lot with school.
10208,"I can not live without my iphone 4s. It literally has everything i need. From my emails,notes,pictures of my son,games,and the best apps. Honestly I had a Iphone and switched to a android the next week i had to take it back and get my Iphone. Once you have a Iphone you will not want anything else.  "
10209,Wouldn't want any other phone.. I don't know why some people complain about it. I have never had a problem & it it's always been a breeze to use. I love my iphone 4s
10210,"I was never much into apple products besides my iPod but ever since I have gotten an iPhone 4s I am addicted! This phone is amazing and I am not sue how I ever lived without it. I don't so much use Siri but everything else this phone does is amazing. Great battery life, great camera, and height/width/weight!"
10211,There the iPhone and then theirs the others!
10212,I love my iPhone 4. It gives me faster service and lots of wonderful apps that I use daily!! 
10213,"I'm not sure how my life would run without my phone. It helps me connect with people in my personal life as well as business needs, (emails, client calls, Facebook). "
10214,"I brought the iPhone 4S in November 2011, and I'm still happy with the purchase. This phone does everything I need it to. I would recommend people to make sure they get it on the Sprint network. This phone will kill your monthly data allotment with any other phone provider. "
10215,I love my phone. The camera is better than any other phone. It is easy to use and the apps and games are the best. 
10216,"I kept waiting until the iPhone was available for Verizon, then once that happened, I kept waiting for the next available phone.  I could no longer keep waiting, so I got my first iPhone last October and I'm not disappointed!  I've been a Mac junkie for years, so it was only a matter of time before I got my iPhone and I'm loving it!!!  I haven't had any issues with it in over a year!"
10217,"This is probably one of the most simple phones I've ever used. It runs quickly, is very touch sensitive and does everything you need it to."
10218,The iPhone 4s was my first smartphone and I'm in love with it. There honestly isn't a single thing about this phone that I don't like. I've been a fan of Apple products for a long time and the iPhone 4s definitely lives up to any expectations that you have of it.
10219,"I have had an iphone since the 3gs came out and it is my go to phone I currently want the new iphone 5 but I've decided to wait until the next one afterwards to save. I love everything that you can do like my apps, music, etc. It's the best phone I've ever had!"
10220,"I will give you my honest opinion about my IPhone 4s. I started out using Android as my first smart phone. And had several different ones. I was impressed with Androids and thought there was nothing that I couldn't do. So my opinion of the Android has always been top notch. So when I  finally did change to an IPhone S4 I was really thrown for a loop.I have had the Iphone for 6 -8 months now and I do enjoy the phone, but for an older person it has definitely been a great experience. I know that the younger folks catch on to everything. But it is a different system and it takes a little different avenue to learn. So to say that I have enjoyed learning this phone as much as I did the other type phones. So therefore I can't rate the I Phone with a high rating to begin with.
."
10221,I purchased an iphone 4 about 2 months ago as an early birthday gift for myself. Once I got it I could not stop playing with it. The battery life is amazing and lasts longer than most phones that are sold today! #teamiphone ! I am loving it!
10222,I used to have the iphone 4 then i got the iphone 4s and i love it its the best phone out there it does everything and has a lot of great free apps iv never had a problem finding a case! but if you go for this phone get the lifeproof case it is the best thats what i have on it and iv dropped in deep puddles and never had a problem!!
10223,I love all apple products and this one is no exception. the sleekness and easy to use features makes this phone usable for any generation. all the features are up to date and the apps are amazing. i truly enjoy this phone and would recommend it to anyone.
10224,"I have been known to be constantly changing my phone, I had about every android brand you could think of till I laid hands on this little puppy. The Iphone offers great apps, safe sharing and fast service. Pictures come out great, high quality and Siri is very helpful when on the run and needing quick information. Over all I am an Iphone Junkie and will recommend it to anyone."
10225,I love the iphone it has all you need. All of the apps it comes with cam come in handy and it also has great camera quality.
10226,Our whole family have these and love them!!
10227,"The iPhone to me at first, was an overpriced hunk of junk....until, I finally owned my first iPhone 3G. This phone at the time did it all, played video games, calls, messages, and of course their unlimited choices of apps. After a while, I realized I was growing bored of my iPhone so I made the choice of buying an android.....boy was I wrong, the iPhone felt better, smoothr, cleaner when it ran.  The battery was amazing, or at least for me it was. I currently have an iPhone 4S, and I know this phone will last me for a very long time"
10228,Once you own a iphone you can never go back to another type of phone!
10229,I've had my phone for about a year and in my opinion it doesn't live up to the hype. I alsi own an android and I prefer it. 
10230,I love my iPhone 4S.  I basically love the iPhone in general. I think that the organization and navigation on iPhones is much simpler and easier than other smart phones!  
10231,I have been happy with it since i got it! i love my phone. =)
10232,"My last phone I had was the Env3 and was ready to get something more helpful even tho it was going to cost me more a month. For what I was paying each month for my Env3 I had just basic text messaging and 450 minutes and was paying alot. So I went with the iPhone 4s & I love it! Hate the battery life but love the phone - apps, camera, etc. Best decision I made yet & worth the money I pay each month. "
10233,Ths phone is great.  Love everything about it.
10234,I have had the iPhone for 2 yrs now and I'm still loving it.
10235,Love that I can FaceTime without wifi
10236,Ive only ever had an iphone and i refuse to change! Somple to use but effective.
10237,Iphone 4s is like my life i shop on it and blog on it its jsut amazing
10238,I love the iPhone 4s smart phone because it is very smart and easy to use! cool features and fun apps to play! LOVE
10239,I would never trade my iphone for anything. definitely one of my best investment. 
10240,"The only thing about the new iPhone 5 that even interests me is the better camera. BUT the camera with the iPhone 4S is sufficient for even decent sized prints, and I'm not willing to fork over $800 for the minimum capacity 5 just for a slightly bigger screen and slightly better camera. The front facing cam on the 5 is obviously a plus, but for now I'm sticking with my 4S because it has NEVER failed me. I love this product, and even for vlogging and photography, it is AWESOME. Never looked back, and not looking forward, really... LOL Love this product - what more can I say?"
10241,"Both of my parents have this phone, while I have the iPhone 5 but I used to use the 4S often and it is an amazing phone. I love it ALOT."
10242,"I went from the Galaxy S III which i HATED to the Iphone 4S and have never been so impressed with a phone. its ease of use, simple to attach to my computer and the fact they have the Cloud storage is irreplacable."
10243,Best phone...so functional. I've never wanted anything else!
10244,"I love my iPhone 4S, I only wish I could import my music from other devices on it such as my amazon account but oh we'll overall great phone."
10245,I have an iPhone 4 and I love it. The only difference is Siri and honestly I've heard that she isn't that good!
10246,"
I CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THIS THING(: SO FAST AND HOLDS CHARGE FOR SO LONG!!!!"
10247,I love all apple products having a small apple product in my Pocket couldn't get better 
10248,"I have used many phones in the past (Blackberry, Android) but the iPhone is by far the best!"
10249,Got this phone 2 months ago like but still have things to learn on it.
10250,I really love this phone and everything about it. I have had lots of phones and even ones deemed the iPhone killer but I like this better. 
10251,Once I started down the Apple path I've never looked back. Once you have an iPhone you rarely need to use a desktop computer.
10252,"My iPhone is very reliable. It has everything I need, and more! I know it will never break on me. "
10253,LOVE THIS IPHONE4
10254,"I absolutely love this phone! Other than getting the iPhone 5, I don't want to ever get a new phone because I love it so much.  I does everything I need it too.
"
10255,My phone is perefect way better then the 3gs version and as good as the 5 which is totally overpriced tgis phone has lasted me 2 years witg no problems at all
10256,Love my iPhone. Wouldn't trade it for any other phone out there. Does anything and everything I need or want. 
10257,"I LOVE my iPhone 4s. I have no reason to trade it for an iPhone 5. My internet is super fast, SO easy to use and really fast. 

I can do pretty much anything with this phone, and I always need this with me when I go out. "
10258,Always in hand. Everywhere I go. I love my IPhone!!
10259,"I'm actually on my iPhone 4S right now! I love it!!! It has a great camera, a very fast processor, and I can get on all of my favorite websites with the touch of a finger. Siri is also a great addition to this phone. "
10260,"I got my first iPhone last year - the 4s when it first came out. Before then I had been a Blackberry user for three years. I can easily say: I will NEVER own another brand of phone again! Now that I've had an iPhone I honestly cannot see myself using anything else. Greatest apps, great camera, user-friendly... It has it all! Apple forever!"
10261,"I have the white iPhone 4s. It is the most amazing cell phone I've ever had!! It does everything I need it to. My mom said she'd never get an iPhone because she hates Apple. I finally convinced her into getting the 4s, and she is in love with it. Her favorite phone by far! I will never own another phone unless I upgrade to another iPhone."
10262,"I got the very first iPhone as a hand me down, then a 3GS, but this one is by far my favorite. I actually really like the more squarish design of the 4/4S, and this phone is so much faster than the hand me downs I got, haha. It fits perfectly into my tiny hand, and that's great, because I thought that it might be awkward since a lot of the smartphones I've seen have been super huge. It's great for taking pictures, listening to music, playing games (and obviously for phone calls), and overall, I'm really satisfied with it."
10263,This phone does everything I need it too. I feel naked without it
10264,"Since I got my iPhone 4S I love it , it a great phone to have "
10265,IPhone was the first top talked about phone. Everyone wanted one of course. Definitely don't disappoint. Quicker ios and have all the best apps of course. Wish it was thinner like the s3 and had a bigger screen
10266,I received my iPhone 4s in September and i use it for appointments and keeping track of everything! i love it and highly recommend it!
10267,"Outdated tech
Overpriced because of the brand
Flimsy design
3g really?
Black or White? Give me another color option

Android wins sorry"
10268,Went to apple about 4 years ago and I will never go back to anything else! Best cell phone ever!!
10269,"I would never use a other phone ever! iPhone is the BEST,I love apple. You can do it all with his phone, I set up my business meeting, reminders, my shopping list, and appts. I recommend iPhone to everyone, their customer service is awesome!!"
10270,Its really convienient but i wish i got the samsung galazy the pic quality isn't as good people really go for it and they steal iphones i lost my first one :/ it freezes sometimes sometimes random apps pop up or close on me 
10271,The iphone 4s is very good the only thing is my phone dies all the time and the brightness turns its self off
10272,Love my iPhone 4S I was a blackberry user from the time smart phones came out and just got my iPhone last year. I am always on line as I run a couponing website solely from my iPhone. I don't have a computer so I do everything on it. It's amazing I love it
10273,"I got the iphone4 when it first came out and love it. Many of the apps that I need or want I can find for free. There are tons of apps and you can find one for almost anything. This phone is very useful if you are a busy on the go person because you can use the calander, set appointments, record videos and take pictures. I used this phone a lot while I was in college to record videos and take pictures for tests as well as put in my work schedule, homework, and tests. "
10274,Love love love this phone!!! Does everything but your dishes and so many apps to choose from.
10275,"I was so pro Blackberry and didn't see the need to switch. Now that I know what I've been missing, I will never go back. This phone is amazing. It's like having a computer in the palm of your hand. "
10276,Always big fan of Apple got iphone 4s  and ipad mini and love them 
10277,I have owned an iPhone ever since they came out. My fist iPhone screen broke (as with most) so I switched over to a Motorola. That phone did not last as long as my iPhone. After that I have been iPhone ever since! They last 2+ years if you take care of them. After that your contract expires which means you can upgrade to the newest version! Great for the money if you can take care of a phone.
10278,I have had my iphone for a very long time and have not gotten bored of it. it is like a mini laptop.
10279,"This is the first, and only, smartphone I've ever used but after hearing what people had to say about other smartphones I know I'll never get rid of my iPhone, unless it's to upgrade. "
10280,"I love mine! I have the 4s with AT&T as my carrier and I love it!  I am writing this review from my phone while I rock my 1yr old.  

This phone is simple, sleek and easy to use.  The apps are amazing.  It's like a mini computer in your pocket "
10281,I had a google before which was ok but I could not wait to get and I phone. I love mine! They have a much better app market than the android and more fun to use in my opinion. The battery life also seems longer. The only thing I wish is that their were free music apps like the android has but all and all I'm happy. You can get them through at&t for $99.00 with contract right now. 
10282,I loved(just updated to the 5)my 4s. I had no complaints. I used itfor school to just socializing. It was just perfect for me. The only reason i updated was because I had the option because I changed to a new carrier. Totally recommend this phone!
10283,"I had the 4 prior to this one and now Ive upgraded to the 4s and I love it. Although the battery life isn't the best, all of the features of the phone make up for it. "
10284,I love this phone! its my favorite phone ever! i love all the cases you can get for it (:
10285,I have the iPhone 4 and 4S and what the heck Siri is no help? I'm sorry but my next phone will be with Samsung or google!  The truth is it's all Hype and honestly in feel dumb because I fell for it. Lol! Don't get me work g I love  Apple  products I just wasn't impressed as I thought in would be.
10286,"I have had a couple of iPhones now and I love them I currently have the iPhone 4S, I love that I have everything I need at my finger tips! I need directions I have a GPS I want to listen to music I have a iPod I need to pay a bill on the run I have apps. I love that my life is all in one place and that I can manage it so simply!  Although as much as I love my phone I do hate that it's so easy to brake it I learned my lession with my last iPhones outterbix is a must' screen protesters a must! "
10287,It has everything i looked for in a phone. Looks great. It is a little exspenive. overal a great phone.
10288,My iphone is stuck to my hip it does everything i need it to do i will not be switching phones i love apple products so helpful so many useful apps number 1 phone in my book 
10289,This phone can do pretty much everything! I love it and would not trade this phone in for any other. 
10290,"I am just not that impressed with the 4s. I think for some it is more about the name. I hate the on screen keyboard, after having an HTC evo for two years the 4s just kind of felt like a kid's toy. The photo quality doesn't touch the HTC Evo with a ten foot pole, and mine crashed so many times, I traded it it for another android phone, this time the galaxy Note...much better."
10291,"I love my iphone i have had mine for almost a year (i needed to upgrade since my other phone broke) so i thought why not
It does all i need and more Great phone"
10292,"So easy to navigate, great for music, and loads of apps avaliable!"
10293,"Amazing phone, so handy and convenient. Best phone I've ever had!"
10294,Simply amazing 
10295,Wow! Finally got an iPhone as soon ad they were available on Sprint! Best decision ever! I find new uses for my iPhone every day!! ( also helped me rediscover a latent love of photography)
10296,"Clear calls, and small and convenient."
10297,"I had the iPhone 3G, 3Gs, 4, and every one after that, I've loved the iPhone since it came out, but honestly I LOVE my iPhone 5 more than any other phone I've had. The 4s is a great phone! Siri is an awesome feature!"
10298,"Hands down, Apple products will always dominate the cell phone industry. Nothing will beat its touch interface and simplicity."
10299,This phone has everything i need!
10300,I switched from blackberry to iPhone! I would never go back!
10301,"There is just nothing I don't like about this phone! I was an Android user for years, got the iPhone and haven't looked back since! I've never had an issue. It's my baby. ;)"
10302,"I love my iPhone 4! The battery life is awesome, way better compared to the droid incredible I had to charge twice a day. It's fast and has yet to freeze. I can do just about everything that I can on my computer from my phone.. So so handy! "
10303,"The I phone 4s in my opinion is sort of over rated. I'll admit some of the things this phone can do are pretty cool but, they have a lack of free apps most of them you have to lay for. I prefer android, they have a ton of free apps and awesome processor. The I phone stays they same pretty much no new looks or anything personally change is a good thing and this phone needs some change."
10304,Its a very nice phone.. the best touchscreen.. i once had an iPhone.. its fun.. good for business and others..
10305,"It's incredible! It's LIFE CHANGING! Making the change over to an iphone 4S was the best move that I have ever made. So many every day things can be done through your iphone. I am able to pay bills, I am able to board flights, I am able to see my nieces and nephews who live in other cities just by a swipe of a finger! It's truly a asset to anyone who buys it!"
10306,I love my iPhone 4S!! Seriously I am doing something on it all the time. There are so many apps and different things. I also love that there are so many different cases and snap overs available almost anywhere you can think of. I am definitely an iPhone user for life!
10307,"And fell under its spell! I've gone through nearly every single generation of this iphone, but I think I prefer the 4S over any other gen (including the 5th). It's perfect!"
10308,I love my phone
10309,I would be absolutely lost with out it. Love it. Could never imagine life without it! 
10310,"The good: The iPhone 4 offers enhanced performance, a lovely new display, and an improved design. It also adds a ton of sorely needed features, both by itself and through the iOS 4 update.

The bad: Multitasking entails some trade-offs, and home screen folders are limited to 12 apps. AT&T reception continues to be spotty, and you'll need a case for the best calling reception. Also, we'd prefer a 64GB model.

The bottom line: With the iPhone 4, Apple again shows that it is a powerful player in the smartphone wars. It won't be for everyone, the call quality and reception vary if you don't use a case, and AT&T's network remains a sticking point, but the handset's striking design, loaded feature set, and generally agreeable performance make it the best iPhone yet."
10311,Je suis absolument en amour avec mon iphone. je ne peux pas m'empecher de telecharger de nouvelle photo et les applications sont tout simplement malade ! 
10312,I love using Siri. This is a great phone I just wish the screen was a little bigger. I'm #TeamApple for life. Androids just can't compete
10313,I love my i phone 4s I wouldn't trade it for anything !!!!
10314,"My husband was the first one to get an iPhone. I had just gotten a blackberry so I was ""content"". He was constantly bragging to me trying to get me to just say that I was jealous. In the end, we both won-He heard me admit that I liked his better and I got one. Don't plan on switching any time soon. 
Oh, and siri is a trip sometimes!"
10315,Its honestly just a big hype. there are way better phones out there like the galaxy s3 and other samsung phones. Apple is very limited with software and I'm just not a fan. I'd rather have an open soure program like android with a WAY bigger screen.
10316,"I have had my iPhone about a year and a half now. I love it to death, but I recently had an issue with the power button. I guess it's pretty common mistake. It's going to cost $150 to replace phone, but I wouldn't trade my phone for anything."
10317,I've had this phone for nearly a year with no complaints. I won't be switching anytime soon either. This phone does everything I need it to and more! Love my iPhone 4!!
10318,"I loved my iPhone 4S. I have since gotten the 5 for the improved camera. My only complaint about the 4S is Siri does not behave as advertised in the commercials. Half the time she doesn't understand what I say, or she doesn't give me the info I want."
10319,"I'll never own a different cell phone brand if I can help it. Apple makes the best product for those who crave reliability, networking, and have an overall on-the-go attitude about life. The Iphone 4S can help you track your life for you. From Siri to its enormous catalog of available apps, you will find something about this phone that will change your mind about how the world works."
10320,I absolutely LOVE the iPhone. i will NEVER go back to android. i have had 0 problems with iPhone. i have had it for almost 2 years and I'm debating on even upgrading to the iPhone 5. The iPhone is a must have for me for sure.
10321,Theres a case to fit every personality and style. A bit on the pricey side  but well worth blinging out your phone!
10322,I love love love my iphone 4s. Its a great phone with all perks. Team iphone!!!
10323,BUY ONE ITS WORTH IT
10324,"I love my iPhone! Not too hard to use, not overpriced and is just the right size and weight! I love how it connects with ease to my other Apple products :)"
10325,I have had my iPhone4 for a few weeks and love it! The apps are awesome and easy to use.  Highly recommend this phone.
10326,I love my iPhone I'm on it non stop. I never had a smart phone before it and now I can never go back.
10327,I switched phones for 2 weeks to an android...then went back to the iPhone!
10328,"I love my iPhone! It's one of the best phones I've ever had, it holds a charge for a long time and works quickly and efficiently."
10329,This phone is amazing it does everything I need it too and has great battery life for a smartphone 
10330,Once you go apple you never go back. I have always had androids and since I got this phone I have not been able to use an android again. This is super fast and easy. The camera is great. Videos are of great quality and I just love everything about it.
10331,I've had an iPhone for at least two years and it has been the best upgrade I have ever made! Being able to just search up anything and have more than one tab to do it is very efficient.
10332,I love my iPhone. so much. I've had one for the last 3 years now and just got the 4s in september. its cheaper than the 5 and virtually almost the same phone! I would absolutely recommend iphone for anyone. :)
10333,The phone is a handy dandy phone that is one in everything for you daily use. The battery does quickly though.
10334,I've been wanting this for a long time. Now that I have it I love it. I'm always either playing games or texting or something on it. It's been great for finding places and other stuff too!
10335,I love my iphone4s! The best :D 
10336,"This product is amazing, ive got to be honest i cant live without it. However it is big and bulcky, the wide screen is very helpful. "
10337,So far! its the best phone i have had so far.. but a member of my family just got a Samsung galaxy and i loved it  and enjoyed it better then the iphone right now..i like the design better and most of the features.. but again it comes down to personal preference.
10338,I like to play games on my phone
10339,I love my iPhone. I got it back in August 2012 and it is so great. 
10340,I've had quite a few phones and the IPhone is by far the best phone ever! It has a nice look and is so handy! It's not very sturdy but it's the best and I am obsessed with this phone! 
10341,I loooooove my iphone. it pretty much does everything that my macbook can do. i can synch all of my calendars and contacts with it. download a ton of apps and games. really easy to use and convenient. only problem is that the battery doesn't last as long as i wish it would
10342,The iPhone 4s is a great phone! It does everything you would need it too! Apple products are great!
10343,It is a great phone but androids do so much more
10344,I love my iPhone it is amazing! The apps are great and I love the fact that there are free apps 
10345,Yay kool
10346,I love my iPhone and never what to go to a different brand. I love the turn by turn directions and how user friendly it is. 
10347,This phone is perfect ! The front camera is really good. One can really tell the difference between the front cameras of iphone 4 and the iphone 4s. Also the GPS on iphone 4s talks. What can I say Apple products are just the way to go. 
10348,"I wasn't an Apple fan until I received my first nano.  Then I purchased the iPhone 4 and upgraded to the 4s with the premiere of the 5.  I like the applications and user-friendliness.  I do wish it had some features, like the paper photo deal the galaxy has.  All-in-all, I wouldn't trade the phone for anything.  Syncing everything to my devices is so convenient.   "
10349,"This iPhone is basically my life. I do anything and just about everything on it. Lately, after 2 years of owning it, I'm starting to have trouble with it, but it's been a rough ride. If you want a sturdy phone that is like a personal computer.. this is the way to go!"
10350,"I got my first iPhone in September. I have been using iOS since the first generation iPad was released and have quickly fallen in love with it. I love how it just works. Coming from Android, a platform that I still stand strongly behind, I was a bit hesitant. I am far from disappointed.  I am pleased with how easily it is to sync my iPad, iPhone and MacBook Air together and have everything I need on each device. I am also thrilled with the battery life which is spectacular. "
10351,Overall it's a great phone! Touchscreen and ability to download all the apps you want. Couldn't ask for a better phone :)
10352,I love all the iphones everyone of my friends have one and it is amazing and i recommend it to everyone !
10353,"I have this smartphone, and I use it for everything! It's quick and if I need to search or do something on my computer at home, I have my iPhoneto do the same job. Siri is a great assistant as well!! "
10354,I had the phone and didn't like to well and but the worst part is I can't speak some words well and the phone didn't take me to what I need and the GPC took me to the wrong address I was lost in Kansas City.
10355,"I've always been a fan of Apple products. I got an iPod the first week they ever came out. I've continued to be a loyal customer of Apple products for the past several years. They've failed to let me down. I got an iPhone 4 when they came out, and I loved and cherished it up until this past August when I got my iPhone 4s. It does everything I need it to. It holds all of my music, and I've never had any sort of major problems with it that turning it off and on again couldn't fix. It's a great buy."
10356,I had it for about 2 years and never wanna change for another
10357,To me it's sometimes slow but is really a great phone with a great camera for something on a phone . And there are lots of apps to choice from.
10358,"My sister has this phone. I love it! iPhones are the best phones, they can do anything. :) I love my iPhone 4 too! "
10359,The best phone ive had yet and its the ohone that has more quality than all the others it has lasted longer than my past phones
10360,"Personally I love my iphone, but with each one coming out, I don't see a difference between this one and the iphone 4. "
10361,"I absolutely love my iphone 4s, best phone ever. although it has had a few problems after only a few months. i had it replaced and I'm definitely still happy with the phone."
10362,"I've been in a relationship with Apple product since about 2004 and I love them. Some functionality issues are handled better by android, but apple makes up for it in other ways in the iPhone 4s."
10363,"To be honest i totally love it. i especially love siri,everything and everyone should get!!"
10364,I was always afraid of trying a full touch screen but i do have to say i love it 
10365,I've had this phone since it first came out and I have loved it unconditionally. The only annoyance is that the battery runs down pretty quickly.
10366,Absolutely love this phone i don't leave home with out it many great features
10367,"I finally made the jump to the iPhone and I haven't regretted it since! My first iPhone is the 4s, and I look forward to the 6 when it comes out! Super recommend!"
10368,"I got my 4s a year ago and its still like new! it does everything I need it to do and more. I use it to do all my social networking, and as a camera for taking pictures for my blog. "
10369,If you like slower internet and a smaller screen get this phone. the iPhone 5 is bigger and has LTE its way cooler don't be a cheap-o and get 5
10370,Can't live without my iPhone. Its amazing.
10371,I purchased an iPhone 4 shortly after the 4S came out. It would have been a 5 week wait for the 4S. The only difference I can tell is 4S has Siri and the 4 does not. I may upgrade to a 4S sometime for Siri but I doubt it.
10372,Don't like it at all. i have had one about a month and i hate it. I'm going back to android asap. don't like the mac operating system. its already out of memory and no place to add a sd card.
10373,Honestly this phone is amazing! You can download as much games as possible and there are also more programs for entertaining. Also many business apps available
10374,I loved my Iphone 4s. Siri helped with the fights and being lost. Only thing I didn't like is the battery life. 
10375,"I do love it very much! And I'm hooked! And I love asking Suri stupid questions! Given I got this phone when I was 21, and yes it was my first cell phone. Don't laugh! lol!"
10376,Certainly in LOVE with all Apple products!!!! They are the best! 
10377,"One of the top phones at the moment! Apple does it again with the iphone 4s. It is a good size, the camera is good and if you get a 2 yr cell agreement, its a good price. Also since the iphone 5 is out, you can even get it for almost free from the cell carrier."
10378,"Been using this phone for about a year, still love it till this day. What I love most about this phone is the camera. Best phone camera around"
10379,"I absolutely love the 4s. I've used the 3, 3Gs, the iPod touch 4th gen and the iPad 2nd gen, but I honestly think the 4s is my favorite. It's so simple and compact and does everything I could ever ask of a phone."
10380,I couldn't live without this phone! I started with iPhone 3 and haven't looked back!! This phone keeps me connected and is easy to use. Also the software updates are free and the apps are endless! I use my camera and video on a daily basis as well. 
10381,I love my iPhone! I have no idea why I waited so long to get one. I didn't think I would enjoy the touchscreen but it is very accurate! Does almost anything if not there's an app for that!
10382,I went from an android to the iphone after years of waiting and I absolutely love this phone and will only have an iphone from now on!!
10383,I just got mine a week ago. The touch screen is nice and easy to use. But I recommend you get a sturdy case this thing will break if dropped had enough. I recommend the survivor case. Dropped mine plenty of times and not even a scratch or glitch :)
10384,"I've had my iphone for about 6 months now I bought it because my stratosphere which is an android broke on me, and i regret not even getting this since the begginging, its amazing, no problems charging it, batteries great and the touch screens amazing no problems like i thought i would have.!"
10385,This phone is a lil complicated at first but you get the hang of it later!
10386,Everything i want and need in one place
10387,I love my iPhone. It's like a little computer in my hand. But sometimes it has little glitches like it would just reboot itself. But I love it.
10388,I love this thing! I never had a thought about switching phones!
10389,"I recently got an Iphone4. I had been using the 3. Its really a great phone, I enjoy it a lot more than the three. I love, love, love the front facing camera on it!!"
10390,"I love this phone so much, has so much storage and Siri. Everyone in my house has the iPhone 5 I see no need for the upgrade. It is very easy to set up, I am someone that has trouble with new gadgets. "
10391,"I am an Apple fangirl ! I have Apple products such as the iPhone, Macbook and iPad. My previous phone was a Samsung but I had to switch over to the iPhone because of the design and all the apps it had compared to the Android market. I love everything about this phone and would recommend the iPhone to anyone who has never owned one."
10392,"I really love my iPhone 4s, it's a great cell phone, the front camera i'ts a plus, i really love the fact that you can made video calls with skype or face time. Me encanta este telefono amo la calidad es super rápido, tiene buena memoria, la calidad de la pantalla es excelente."
10393,"I had my iPhone 3GS for THREE years!  It was time for a much needed upgrade as it was getting very slow and would crash all the time.

I got the iPhone 5 and I did not like it one bit.  I'm always on the go, in school, looking up something, with a friend, etc. so I had to have a phone that is not only dependable but doesn't chug battery life like crazy.  iPhone 5 did just that!  Also, I have small hands so I don't think the size of it affected it too much, but I can see that being a problem with other people!

I exchanged the iPhone 5 for the iPhone 4S on the basis that the battery was dying too quickly!  

I'm so happy that I exchanged it!  I love the iPhone 4S, the battery life is awesome!  The only thing I don't like is that the old YT app is gone and same with old Google Maps...but I guess that's another review!!! "
10394,"So I got my $s at the end of 2012, Can I tell you that coming from a 3s was like night and day, I love my phone. It does everything I need it to do plus more. It keeps me in the know and i would be lost without it. Thank you Steve jobs. This phone isn't just a label, it the functionality is what you pay for. Unlike most of those imitation touch screens the Iphone is consistent in the tech world. Batteries never blow our handsets and we are always up to speed using out internet. this is the phone of the future only now."
10395,This is the best phone that I have ever owned!
10396,"Does everything u could think of so go out and buy
one right now."
10397,"I use my iPhone 4S for everything! Homework, social media,music, games, videos, navigation. I got my iPhone 6 months ago and I will never get another phone that isn't an iPhone. But remember to chose the best carrier because some charge an unreasonable amount of money a month. My iPhone has never even died either! The battery lasts a Long time."
10398,The iPhone 4S is by far the best smartphone I have ever owned. All of my other cell phones over the years have died well before the two year contract is up. This phone is still going strong and I'm planning on getting the newest iPhone when my contract runs out!!! 
10399,"I am an apple fan, and have been for years. I willl admit that I started out as a blackberry girl, but am no longer one!
I started out with the iphone 3gs and upgraded to the 4s when it came out, and have never looked back!
In the beginning Siri annoyed me to DEATH! with the new software updates Siri is now a bit more intuitive on my speaking pattern, but you really have to be patient with her. 
I couldn't live without this phone now!! "
10400,Hubby has this phone and I am jealous. I love it. I can't wait to upgrade my plan. I plan on getting an iphone.  
10401,"I absolutely adore my iPhone 4S. I finally upgraded my basic cell phone to an iPhone last year, and will never go back! The features, apps, camera, are awesome!"
10402,Its really user friendly but controlled by apple 
10403,"I don't have one but i have used it so shri is not all that  great   to me it not better  then the 4
"
10404,"Never owned an iphone or apple product before this, but I've not regretted it. 
However, the price is really high, so therefor this only gets a B. "
10405,"I was #TEAM BLACKBERRY for sooo long, but my boyfriend is an Apple fanatic. When it was time for me to upgrade, he convinced me to get the iPhone 4s. Let me tell you something...I will NEVER buy another brand of cell phone. This phone is where its at! Apps galore, Siri, voice navigation, instant notifications for everything (Mail, messenger, FB, Twitter, Instagram), fast and reliable wifi, customized contacts, touchscreen capabilities, the ability to locate your iPhone if lost or stolen anywhere in the world...I could go on and on.Your phone CAN'T do everything my iPhone 4s can. Go ahead and get one, you won't be sorry."
10406,BEST PHONE EVERRR!!!!!!!!!!! I have wanted an IPhone for soooooo long and I got one for christmas. Words cannot explain how much I'm in LOVE with my phone! I feel amazing and it's AMAZING!!!
10407,It seems nowadays everyone and their grandmother have an iphone 4s. At first it was such a cool device to have but I soon got tired of it.
10408,"A few things... no one on earth should live without an iPhone. Anything else is like living in the stone ages. When I went from my Blackberry to iPhone I felt like I was walking through time, literally. Though, its important you choose the right carrier. I use Verizon and I'm happy with it to be honest- but to each their own. The 4S is great, but go for the 5. The camera is a lot better and the design is a lot more lightweight and versatile. "
10409,I love this phone it does everything i need it to and more 
10410,"IPhone is the way to go! I have never wanted a different phone (android, windows, etc.) It's been iPhone all the way since I first got an iPhone 3g. Honestly, I'd prefer the 4s over the iPhone 5, it's about the same, and I don't see the hype in it. I prefer a smaller phone because I am a girl and the larger iphone would not fit in my jean pocket and will fall out and possibly break or lose it, so I'd much rather keep all my accessories, docking station, cases I've had and use the iphone4/4s rather than the 5. "
10411,I don't know what I would do without my iPhone 4S!! I lost it a few months ago and was a complete mess without for a few hours! Thankfully it was a weekend and I went the next day for a new one! I have friends that went to the galaxy and are coming back to the iPhone!! I'm never giving up mine!!
10412,I love my Iphone4S. It does everything. I can't leave home without it. 
10413,"Successful on there Iphone4s! Very easy to get accustomed to, so it would be great for any age range. I was very satisfied with this phone."
10414,"This phone is good for certain people. It is very easy to use and everything is upfront and very accessible. It has a very nice camera and the screen was class leading up until recently when the Nexus 4 beat in in PPI. I just think that the amount of feature I want in a phone are just not there yet, and might not ever be. The ability to have widgets is not there, they only recently got a notification bar in ios 5 which they stole from google. Everyone knows ios 6 was a joke with apple maps and getting people lost in the desert. I just think that since Steve Jobs is no longer with us Apple has went down hill and fast. They aren't innovative anymore and they are hurting their customer base with not bringing out meaningful updates. Everyone at Apple knows this and some are starting to jump the iPhone ship and move to Android. This is a nice phone for certain people, just not all and especially not me."
10415,I had an android before I got an IPhone and then a blackberry before that and the iphone is by far my favorite of the three.
10416,"I would be lost with out my iPhone 4S. I use my phone a lot for business, and it's the best thing to have on me when I travel. I can make sales, book keeping, networking and so much more. Also there are the games that not only interest me they keep my sons attention if we are in line at a store or at the drs office. There's so many apps and always new ones to choose from. You can also personalize your phone with so many different phone covers and there are ones that fully protect your phone with shock absorbency, water proof and hard shells and screen protectors."
10417,"I have the 5th now and had the 4th, one word...
AMAZING "
10418,What I love mostly about iphones is that's there's many apps you can download. Also there's so many cute cases that you can find for it
10419,Suck a grea slik and grea over al wokin / looking phone 
10420,This has to be the best phone I've had yet! Loved it so much I got the ipad as well!
10421,"Never had an issue with it, works great and I can do everything I want on it. "
10422,"Iphone made me  love apple. It's small, yet has all the functions i need-- alarm, games, music, texting, calling, siri, etc. :)"
10423,"I like this phone a lot. The upgraded features compared to the older models are nice, but I am not a Siri fan. She isn't the smartest tool. "
10424,The iPhone only gets better and better. Love taking Macro style photos with the camera. And for misc other pics I'm glad it has an optional flash. Great to run apps & organize your life. Comes in white or black. Recurring updates w/new software keep you going strong while your waiting out the 2-yr contact signed to buy it discounted. 
10425,Its a good phone but i just wish it had 4G!
10426,Ive had Iphones for a while now and it helps me with everything. I love how much it can help me with everything
10427,I got an iPhone3 shortly after they came out. I am hooked. I love my iPhone 4S. It is really my lifeline. From basic phone calls/text message to the multiple apps I use on the daily. The ability to maintain an organized life with my phone is essential to me. I love apple and am a huge fan of this phone. 
10428,I have the iphone 4 and i absolutely love it! I would never go back to a blackberry! 
10429,"I've never really had any issues with this phone unlike all other phones I've ever had. I wish the screen was a bit bigger. But other than that, i love everything about this phone. Feels very sturdy. As long as you buy a good phone case for it, it's not as easy to crack the screen as a lot of people say. Trust me, I've dropped my phone PLENTY of times. "
10430,"I got my iPhone 4s 64G for Christmas in 2011. Very user friendly, and lots of fun. I use my phone for everything anymore, e-mail, facebook, surfing the net,banking, shopping, etc, etc, etc, and you can even call people with it. LOVE IT!"
10431,I bought an iphone 4s a little over one year ago and I will never go to another phone again! I have never ever in my life liked a phone let alone love one and I absolutely love my iphone! 
10432,"Had an iphone since iphone 3g and I wont ever change, i now have an iphone 4s and Siri calls me Craft Master =)"
10433,"I love the iPhone 4S! 
I am always recommending this phone to friends, and I honestly don't know why you'd go either way! 
Yes, other phones have different features, but I have tried many of these phone claiming to have the newest and best features and all of them have always ended up the same. 
SLOW. 
What's nice about the iPhone is that the speed doesn't change from out of the box to 2 years later. I know with any android phone I've tried, the first few months are great and randomly they get slow and never work the same!
The apps are great, the speed is great...
Why haven't you tried this yet?
Just go for it!"
10434,What else is there to say?? Simply the best!
10435,"I wasn't crazy about the iPhone and didn't get the hype. After having multiple phones malfunction I gave it a shot and am in love.
The iPhone is so user friendly for any age, my 16 year old brother loves his as much as my 54 year old step father!"
10436,"Got my first iphone and fell inlove, never will i switch back to a different phone"
10437,I absolutely love my iPhone 4s. I have had a lot of androids and always had problems with them freezing and battery life. I don't have any problems with my iPhone. I will never go back. My iPhone is actually so great that I now own a Mac laptop and only buy Apple electronics. And Siri is very helpful.
10438,"IPhone does it all.
I love all apple products, I had an iPhone 4. It was my world, unfortunately I had to sell it b/c I chose the wrong carrier and couldn't afford the bill. But I still use apple I currently use the iPad..but from when I did have my iPhone it was great. 
So many features.. Love the touchscreen.
Tons of apps. Overall just a great phone
"
10439,"Works like a charm, looks great and has great speed and quality.  super fun and neat apps! "
10440,I definitely cannot live without my iPhone. Love the cool and modern design and everything that the brand offers!
10441,"My husband was my new fiancé. My 2 toddlers were a very distant dream for ""one day"". I remember being at best buy for over 2 hours buying and setting up the coolest phone Eric had ever seen and we both had to have one.  Now it is another appendage. And some people are offended by that and think it is awful to say I couldn't live without it, but I think it is as wonderful addition to a digital world and provides my generation with one of the most cultural changing, efficency gaining(and potentially  time wasting) tool to stay connected, work, play, learns and explore in ways that we couldn't even have dreamed of 15 years ago in the days of a dial up connection to the Internet.  "
10442,"This is a very good phone, great touch screen, too little ram, needs to be larger since new phones came in if you can get a iphone 5 get it camera is awesome, best one out there."
10443,"I have had cell phones/smart phones for years.  I needed a phone that just worked, did what I needed it to do WHEN I needed it to do it.  The iPhone fit that bill and then some.  I've had mine almost a year now through Sprint, and the ONLY complaint I have is that the Swype app that I loved with Android does not work on the iPhone.  Sleek phone, great signal, good sound and pictures, love the apps (there are a LOT of free apps for iPhone).  "
10444,"The most user-friendly smartphone out there, in my opinion. Things that are annoying: Why is it that when I put my phone on silent my alarm isn't? Everything else is. The keyboard is pretty tiny, it'd be nice to have a wider screen (not tall and skinnier, iPhone 5!) Besides that, I really do like my phone and will keep with it. "
10445,"I swore up and down that I would never own an apple product and here I am writing this review in my iPhone 4S. This phone is simple, yet does everything I need it to do and then some. I think a lot of smartphones out there are ever increasing in complications, but the Apple iPhone is so user friendly that I don't see myself turning to another brand anytime soon. "
10446,I love my iPhone! It does everything & keeping track of my daily activities & family had never been so easy. Great selection of apps as well
10447,LOVE IT NEVER TURN BACK
10448,I don't see what the huge hype was over the 4 coming out. i understand we got Syri but still. i got my 4 when it first came out and there was just a lot of bug issues with it that apple had to solve. I still love iphone because its easier for me to use than an android.  
10449,It's not too complicated and takes decent photos! 
10450,"I love all the reviews, and i wanted the Iphone 4, but after reading all this, i will go for this."
10451,"My iPhone 4s is so easy to use! It's easy to navigate, and the apps are so great and endless. I'm addicted. "
10452,My favorite iphone so far! I'm not a fan of the iphone 5. I love the look and feeling of the iphones to.
10453,"I have the iPhone 4s and it is really amazing.  It is so fast and the camera is amazing.  The graphics are really HD and it can store lots of stuff.  Although, I have to say, when I bought it, I was for sure that I would use Siri all the time, but  really don't use her all that often.  But it really is such a great phone, and I recommend it to everyone!"
10454,"The changes to the iPhone 4S are easy to document - the camera has been upgraded to 8MP (with an improved aperture ratio), the CPU is now the same dual-core A5 processor as seen in the iPad 2, and a seven time increase in graphical processing power."
10455,"I don't personally have an iPhone 4 but this is really good if your a busy person or if your always traveling you can make calls,FaceTime, play games,listen to music, and many mor thing."
10456,Im a type of person who drops everything and anything. I saw a friend drop is Iphone and the whole back cracked...Hell nah I'm not buying it
10457,I had the Iphone 4 before and was very happy with it! But I love my 4s. The upgrades are absolutely worth it. I love how simple it is to use. 
10458,"I love my iPhone. I've had one about 3 months, and I don't want any other phone at all. When I had my other phones I always wanted to change phones, but now I want to stay to this onee! (:"
10459,I LOVE my ipgone 4s! I cant live without it. I do everything on it and without it i wouldn't be able to work or live a daily life with ease! Its amazing!
10460,This is my first smart phone and my first iPhone. I love having siri especially when using the Mapquest app. It's also helpful when finding places around the area. I love being connected to the internet and having access to many different apps. 
10461,I love this phone even more than the iPhone 5. I think the size and shapes were a lot better and yes Siri was definitely a big plus for this phone. 
10462,"These are so easy and fun to use. My kids love the free game apps and I love I can I have many books with me without being loaded down.
Only draw back is media flash player is not compatible so you can't view certain website features. "
10463,I switched from android to the 4S a couple months ago. I love everything about it. Everything just makes sense. I like using Siri to open apps instead of having to find them. I use the Maps app all the time and the directions are accurate. The otter box case is a m
10464,I love love love love all apple products..iphone 4s is the best phone i ever used..i shape i love iphone 3s..but 4s also rocks..love it...
10465,"I love my phone, I can do anything any where! I can change the case and I have so many different choices and since iPhones are so popular i can find cases really any where unlike my other phones, i do sometimes miss having a key board but now that I can buy an attachment for it I'm so happy!"
10466,"First iphone and I have to say I'm pretty happy with it. I used to have an android and was skeptical but I love the iPhone, I won't be switching anytime soon"
10467,The best phone ever love it love it love !
10468,I went from a Windows phone to an Iphone and I do not regret it. I love it! Do not plan on going back to android or windows!!
10469,"I've had every platform of phone before. Blackberry, android, etc and this one is by far the best. The battery lasts all day, it's nice to have an iPod and phone at the same time without having to carry both. I gave it a B because it is fragile when dropped. The glass cracks easily. "
10470,I could not imagine not having this phone anymore. It does everything!
10471,"The first iPhone I ever purchased was a 3gs. It was the best phone I had ever had! Then I upgrades to the 4s and fell even more in love with apple. Two months ago I upgraded to the 5. It is almost exactly the same as the 4s which makes not much sense, but no matter what I'll be an iPhone fan for life. I have tired andriod and I'm just not a fan. "
10472,The camera on this phone is pretty awesome so much I don't care a real camera with me. It does drop calls but I am sure that is because my carrier isn't so good.
10473,"My iPhone is my best friend, I love seri she's super helpful with everything the iPhone 4S is not only entertaining but is also really helpful!"
10474,"So I was against getting any Apple products for a long time. Working at Gamestop and USPS, I decided I needed an iPod so I could listen to music while I worked. Well, my hubby found an amazing deal on an Iphone 4s. And bought it for himself while I was working! I had this crappy cheap 4g phone and decided it was time to upgrade. I played with his phone and decided it was time to get my own. Now I love it because no matter where I am or what device I'm using I can access my stuff, music, etc! "
10475,"If you are thinking about getting an IPhone 4S, GET IT!!!:)Siri is amazing, the map icon is better than the Iphone 5 one by FAR! I love dressing up my phone in cases!!haha"
10476,I recently purchased this phone and I love it!  There is so much to do on it that you find yourself caught up in fun!  Highly recommended!
10477,Love it so much. I  had the earlier version and it got dropped. I'm kinda glad because this one rocks !  
10478,Best thing ever. I personally like it better than the iPhone 5 because there is a less chance it will break if you drop it. I also like it more than the iPhone 5 because it is smaller and to me small is the new BIG!
10479,"I love my iPhone so much, I don't know what I'd do without it! There are so many apps I use on a day to day basis. Having them all on my phone makes it so convenient! "
10480,"Just got an iPhone 4 recently after my blackberry broke. Prefer the iPhone over blackberry for sure. iPhone is a phone,iPod and mini iPad all in one!"
10481,"Ive always had a android and switch to a iphone and did not like it. My complaints are small. Screen is to little compared to my GS3, and I am a gmail girl and do not like the layout of the iphone...I am not a fan of the one button feature. Now don't get me wrong...the phone itself is excellent does a 101 things and for the few months I had it I enjoyed but sorely missed my android. Iphone are just not for me, but I know you will love it"
10482,I love my iPhone. the only thing I'd change is the amount of space I have. If I have music then my photo stream fills up after about 100 photos.. but it operates wonderfully :)
10483,I started with the iphone 4 and now have the 4s. It is probably one of the most compatible phones I have ever found. 
10484,"I never had the iPhone, but I have two iPods, so I'd say I'm worthy of writing a review.
The iPod 4 is a bit small for my taste but can still do amazing things! I almost never took my hands off it until I got my fifth gen! Which is much better than the fourth. That's why they made it!
Apple is a genius company but the one issue they could fix is making a screen that can't break :/"
10485,I have the iPhone 4s and it is great! I have more service on this phone then I did my other through the same network. It comes in handy when needing to research a topic or just a great looking accessory. I would recommend this phone to everyone. Get a good case though you want it to be protected when dropped instead of ruining the hardware. 
10486,I LOVE my Iphone 4s. Though I got it thinking I would be using Siri a lot but honestly I never use it. It is nice to be able to say what you want to type in a text message and then it writes it for you. Probably will never switch to any other brand of phone.
10487,Love my Iphone love the app store i can download apps for my 1 1/2 year ols she loves it just as much as i do 
10488,I love my iphone 4s and looking forward to the new model later this year. I love the ease of using the apps and other functions.
10489,"I've had the 4S since the 5 came out. I always wait for the newer ones to come out to get the older ones cheaper. I absolutely love this version the best. I had a 3GS before and had a lot of problems with it breaking. My silence button broke, power button came out, speakers went out a few times, cracked the screen twice, all in about a year. Ive had the 4S for over a year now and have not had one single problem with it. I even dropped it in a cup of water and it still works fine. I don't think I'll switch to the 5 because I don't like that it's bigger than the 4S. Siri is awesome and FaceTime is really cool, too. Absolutely love it."
10490,This is perfect for me. It is durable and lightweight. ITs small and touch screen. Its like a mini computer! I can do almost anything with it! 
10491,I just got my first iPhone in December and I have to say I LOVE it ! The iPhone does it all. Depending on what phone company you have it runs very fast and smoothly ! ( I Have Sprint )
10492,I love this phone only downfall is i wish the glass was made with some thing more sturdy than glass? If that makes sense. I dropped mine and have to get it replaced. BUT thats the only complaint i have about the phone.
10493,I love my iphone i think iphones are so much easier to use and less confusing than androids.They're just amazing!Haha[:
10494,"I feel really strange when I accidentally  forget my phone. It's my phone, my watch, my calendar, etc! I LOVE SURI!"
10495,"I'm obsessed with my iPhone 4s. I am a new mom and I use baby apps, camera, video, Words With Friends, FB, and Twitter daily. Would have been beyond lost without map and contact functions. Oh! Also you can use it as a phone to talk to people. ;)
I'm an Apple girl, so I've tried other smartphones, but the interface is not as easy for me as the iPhone. "
10496,Not what I expected at all no way to increase memory horrible battery life and apple is constantly pushing new updates that steal your memory as well.
10497,"As soon as I began using Apple products I've never used anything else since.  Their operating systems, customer service, and product lines are the best on the market. "
10498,I love this phone it does everything !
10499,"I am a huge Apple fan.  I have a Mac, iPad, and so naturally my next move as soon as my 2 year plan was up was to ditch the Blackberry and pick up an iPhone 4s.  It's incredibly user friendly, the camera rocks, and it syncs well with all my other Apple products!  Sorry BB, but I'm never turning back. "
10500,I've had this phone for a while and honestly been the best phone I've had. There's nothing that this phone can't do.It's a bit pricey than other phones but well worth the money. It includes Siri which is very helpful and you can ask Siri anything and even get him or her to know your name ! 
10501,"I had an android. I switched to iPhone 4s. I loved it. Although Siri and I had some fights over my pronouncing of words, it was a great phone. I didn;t like the process of creating ringtones and I missed access to free music so I switched back to android. Wished I never thought that was a great idea. I would love to go back to the 4S. Great phone!!"
10502,"Got this phone about a  year ago and i have never looked back. i use my phone for texting, e-mailing and apps. i have never had a problem with it doing any of these things. "
10503,You know once you buy an Apple product you are getting your monies worth. I've had a Droid and switched to the iPhone and I will not look back.
10504,"EVERYTHING IS GREAT ABOUT THIS PHONE. THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT YOU CANNOT DO WITH IT.  THE SPEAKERS ARE CLEAR, THE PICTURES ARE CLEAR, RINGTONES ARE CLEAR.  PRICES ARE REASONABLE AS WELL! PERFECT!"
10505,"I've been using apple products for my whole life, and I absolutely love the iPhone.I just recently got the 4s, and it is amazing. It's much faster than my 4, and I wouldn't trade it for the world!"
10506,"The overall look of iPhone4s for me is adorable and stylish. Plus I like how it fits almost everybody's hand perfectly, very easy to grip. Plus it's very handy and functional, the only thing that it lacks is LTE capability and long battery life, but the rest are perfect (:"
10507,I love this phone! It never leaves my side! Just make sure to always keep a case on it and don't drop it! It is the best sidekick you will ever have!
10508,"Ever since I got the iphone 4, I was in love. I upgraded to the 4s as soon as it came out. As did I upgrade to the 5 and am waiting on the 5s and the 6. If you ask me, iPhone is the best phone on the market and always will be...hands down."
10509,"I have had my 4s for about a year and have not had one problem with it, it's fast, fun and oh so useful!!!"
10510,This product is incredible it's light weight great camara for facetiming and it has Siri it's a really good phone to buy
10511,I USE IT A LOT TO DO MY YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND ITS GREAT. I EVEN HAVE AN AP THAT HELPS ME EDIT MY VIDEOS. ITS ACTUALLY BETTER THEN MY CAMERA LOL WHAT I DON'T LIKE IS THAT ITS SO SENSITIVE. I DROPPED IT ONCE AND THERE WENT MY SCREEN. CRACKED :( I HAD AN ANDROID BEFORE THIS AND NEVER DID THE SCREEN BREAK. SO THAT WAS VERY DISAPOINTING. BUT THE BATTERY LIFE IS GREAT ADN ALL OF THE APS YOU CAN GET. SIRI IS COOL TOO. VERY HELPFUL BUT I DON'T REALL USE HER MUCH. 
10512,I drop it all the time and it hasn't broken yet. I had the 3 for a year and a half and the only thing that was wrong with it was I couldn't put it on silent anymore. My phone before that was a touch screen and I had gone through 3 batteries in a year and a half. I love the iPhone 4. It's much easier especially when I already had an iPod touch and iPad. 
10513,I hated this phone and siri is a smartass!
10514,"Coming from the technology center of Tokyo, Japan, saying this is the best phone I've had is an amazing thing. Graphics are amazing. The sound quality with and without headphones is amazing, it's not sketchy or hard to hear. Definitely a keeper!"
10515,"It's awesome, does everything I need it to do. Picture quality is fantastic, videos are great too! Soo many apps for it, iCloud works seamlessly..No complaints and I've been a iPhone user for 3+ years now :)"
10516,Dose almost hint almost every thing!!!
10517,This phone is literally the world in your pocket. It does everything and is your savior when you need it. 
10518,"This is by far the best phone I've had. You can quite literally do anything with it. Search the web, pay your bills, check the status of orders or your phone bill, check your school stuff, its got tons of apps to download both for free and that need to be paid for. Its both a music player, you can watch movies.. possibilities are endless. For me it works great since I'm an avid apple user and all my devices connect together perfectly. I absolutely love that I can use it to tether internet to my comp or iPad! 

However, the battery life sucks with brightness up all the way. Its a flimsy phone, meaning unless you have a lifeproof case or of equal greatness, you will possibly break your screen or get water damage. NOT worth it considering the price. The typing sucks, the autocorrect sucks but turning it off is more of a pain than having it on. Never had an android but wish it had swype!"
10519,Apple never seems to disappoint me but with this product it did. I love the phone and the design but we all want to see battery improvements and with apple they never seem to get it. I recommend this product if you aren't constantly using your phone.
10520,Love my 4S! The 4 was my first iPhone and I never went back to anything else.
10521,"I love my iPhone 4s! I got it about a year ago and 80% of the time its probably in my hand. It has great features and apps! (however some apps are more expensive compared to droid!)

The only downfall I have found with the phone is the Apple Maps & how often it needs to be updated for bugs that were ""fixed in the last update""

I myself haven't shattered my screen, but I know several people who have dropped theirs and broke the glass!"
10522,"I had my iPhone 4s for around a year and it started to run slow, so I decided to get another phone and I'm happy I did! I did enjoy the iPhone because of all of the Apps. It did seem to become overrated and it was like everyone had one. :/"
10523,"This cellphone is the best one I had in a while. You can have everything in there... run apps, music, photos, emails, news etc... amazing product 100% recommend."
10524,I love this phone.  I would never switch!!  It does everything I need it to.  
10525,I got my iPhone 4s for graduation last year. Mine still runs strong and i have never had any problems with it. Plus siri has helped me out of some situations before.
10526,This phone is ok. it freezes sometimes and can be frustrating. not a bad phone because its cheap now but for the money i paid when it first came out its not worth it
10527,I like my iPhone but it's really not much different then any other phone out there. I do like how easy apple makes things work together but again it's a cell phone and much different. 
10528,I have had apple products for the past 6 years and i don't know if i will ever change from a apple product 
10529,Last year for Mother's Day my son bought me an iphone. I use it for everything but making calls. Why? I don't like talking on the phone but using it for the many apps it has is an awesome way to connect with life. I find myself lately using my iphone apps more than I actually use my desk top or laptop computers. Thanks iphone!
10530,Ive own many phones from the EVO to the S3 i would never go back to android this is by far the best phone ever!!
10531,"I've had my phone for over a year and I love it, it still works great and it's almost exact as the iPhone 5 just bigger screen and more expensive. I've had no problems."
10532,I love the iphone. So easy to use. The apps are right in front where you need them. The internet is fast. The battery lasts a long time. The camera is amazing i take a lot of my instagram pictures with it. I love it inwoukn trade it for anything
10533,"I used to have an android phone, and was always complaining about it. It would freeze up and run slowly all the time. Finally when I was eligible for an upgrade, I got the iphone 4s thinking it was a little pricey and worrying I wouldn't like it. Little did I know how amazing this phone is. I LOVE MY IPHONE! I have had no problems out of this phone, and I have had it almost a year now. It's fast, and never freezes. I think I'm always going to stay with apple phone wise. I wish i could afford a mac computer because of how amazing my phone is! :p"
10534,"IPhone 4s was my first iPhone. It is very handy when it comes to writing down notes, finding places what are interesting, and just about anything actually. The only reason why I got this smart phone was because of my boyfriend. So we could FaceTime anytime we wanted too! I also have a problem with hoarding games and such, haha! I totally recommend this. :)"
10535,I love apple product
10536,I went from the 3s to the 4s and WOW was it a difference. I love the front facing camera! I love the HD quality for videos and pictures. I feel like my phone is faster now. I love how you can now have a wallpaper on your home screen. I love the face talk feature as well. I'm loving everything about this phone! Oh and you can NOW with the 4s and not the 3s set custom text tones. 
10537,"I switched from a Droid to an iPhone, and I must say, overall I love the iPhone!  Siri says the funniest things, but you must speak clearly.  Seems to hold battery pretty well.  The map/navigation could use some work - i miss the free one I had on Droid that spoke to me.  I have to pay for speaking now with a different app.  And as always, tons of apps to chose from!! Easy to use as well."
10538,Couldn't be happier with my iphone. Never a single problem and seems to last a lot longer than any of my other phones I've ever had
10539,I think this is a good smart phone and i really like it
10540,I LOVE THIS PHONE ITS REALLY SIMPLE TO USE AND ADDICTING SO ONES YOU GO MAC YOU CAN GO BACK 
10541,The iphone is addictive. Youll find yourself using it for everything because there is always is an app for that. 
10542,"It seems as though everyone has this phone, which means its easy to borrow a power cord [which could easily be a regular USB cord but thanks apple]. All the apps are first available on the iphone, but there are always updates on the software of the iphone."
10543,I LOVE THE IPHONES THEY HAVE REALLY GOOD QUALITY I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO A DIFF PHONE AGAIN!
10544,"I love my iphone, I do almost everything on it. I love it!"
10545,"I have owned 2 iPhones and both have been somewhat of a let down...they don't do what Apple claims. I had to return my iPhone 3, 3 times in 1 year and now have had to return my 4, 2 times since having it. I just wish they would work out all the bugs before they actually sell the product."
10546,"I love my iPhone 4S, it's like my life! The new apps and upgrades make the phone even better!! "
10547,The difference between the 4 and 4s is the Siri. They both work the same. Siri was cute. 
10548,I've tried other products but they all fall short of my iPhone. I even tried an android based tablet. My next purchase will be the iPad. 
10549,"My biggest complaint was the battery wouldn't last very long.  Other than that, I loved it!"
10550,"I would never ever buy this never again. after it dropping on my carpet wile driving, in a 60 dollar case, it broke! never ever again"
10551,I love my iphone. I just hate that I can't download flash player
10552,Will never have another
10553,"I have had a Droid for years, and love my droids. My BF decided to get me an iphone(so sweet of him!) and after a few hours, it wasn't that hard to adjust too... Aside from a back button. I haven't really missed my droid aside from the customization you can give a droid. But, I have all the apps I need and a few more. All together, it's a clean phone. Works smoothly and does everything I need. And although I haven't got to use it yet, I think I'm going to love ""FaceTime"" I don't really miss my droid, and so I'd have to give it a thumbs up"
10554,The iphone 4S was my first ever iphone and now I wonder why in the world did I not go to it sooner.  I love my phone.  Still learning it as I have only had it little over a year.  Would highly recommend.
10555,I love apple products. I can't see ever going to another brand of phone.
10556,I think it is amazing i love my phone and i wouldn't want to switch it because it does everything i need 
10557,I bought this for my son and he says its the bomb!!It never leaves his hand!
10558,The iPhone was my first smartphone . I've never had any problems with it and I don't plan on switching . 
10559,"I don't know if it was just mine, but the apps I had always seemed to freeze up on me. But then again it could have just been the apps themselves. Love this phone though!"
10560,I will never switch. Apple products have exceeded expectations for years. A+
10561,Love playing games and listening to my music on it
10562,"I bought this phone for my husband. We LOVE it! I am able to face time with my mom any time I want, I can easily navigate through apps without hesitation, finding apps are easy, music is easy to download and I love how you can go to one area to find all your purchases. I love all the accessories you can get for it! I love how the speakers are awesome. I love that you can play your favorite games on the go so easily.  I wish the screen was bigger like my HTC, that's why I have it a B rating. "
10563,"I decided on switching from an Android phone to iPhone because I just had too many gadgets! I had an iPod which I loved as well as my phone. So I thought why not just cary 1 item. I sold my iPod & got my iPhone. I love it! I love the fact that if I DO decide to purchase an app, it's come out of the iTunes card/account. I didn't like downloads being linked to a credit card. I also like that it has more FREE educational apps that my grandson loves playing."
10564,"I'm glad I eventually got an iPhone, and my first one was the 4S. It's 10x better than any other Smartphone I've had because of it's speed and compatibility with most programs, apps, etc that I use. Overall the iPhone is great and I wouldn't go back to another type of Smartphone. "
10565,"I am so impressed with my iPhone, even after a year of use! As an android user, I always found myself frustrated with my phone after three or four months.  Battery life always decreased, charges didn't seem to hold, components of the phone that were vital failed to work.  I finally made the switch to the iPhone and have never looked back!  Fellow android users comment on how wonderful my battery life is, and I cannot agree more! I love being able to call, text, listen to music, uses social media sites, and still have some battery life at the end of the day. "
10566,I started using the iPhone a couple of years ago and I have no complaints. It has everything and does everything that I need. I will never go back to any other phone. 
10567,Personally i think people only get the iphone because there friends have it . The iphone has way to much stuff on it for a phone .
10568,"I love me iphone and adore it but it gets glitchy a lot! I try to ask seri a question and she says I can not answer your question at this time! I also hate autocorrect, it doesn't always give me the right words. My lock screen freezes uo as well. But over all I love my iphone
"
10569,This phone is great!  I switched to apple this year and I love that all of my gadgets talk to one another seamlessly.  
10570,I switched to apple when I got sick of my android and the sluggish screen response and crapy battery life and I don't think I'll ever buy a non apple phone again.
10571,"The iPhone does just about everything. Jailbreak it and it will do even more. And remember, it's glass. If you drop it, it might break. Get a case."
10572,"I got my first iPhone several years ago, I had the iPhone 3. Once switching to iPhone, I have not gone back. I love how easy it easy to sync up my music (it's mainly all in iTunes).  I have friends/family that have other types of smart phones, but I prefer the look and features of the iPhone.  My favorite aspect about the 4s is the FaceTime and Siri reading the turn by turn directions on the maps ap.  I have not personally had any problems with the iPhone maps and it has helped me a lot since we just moved to a new city."
10573,"I have had my iPhone 4S since it was released in October 2011 and it is still working as well as when I first bought it. The processor is quite fast and, in addition to all the iOS updates, remains incredible. I love that it is compatible with my other apple products and that it has the iCloud integrated. 

I would highly recommend that anyone in the market for a smartphone look towards Apple products since they are not only reliable but don't damage as easily as Android phones. "
10574,"I love Siri, the phone works great and suits all of my needs, of course, like all iPhones though is will need a strong case because if you drop it once and i cracks the whole thing could die. (I would know from experience haha)"
10575,"After having 3 android devices which all broke and glitched on me, I am finally happy with and will never trade my iphone"
10576,"I love it, and haven't have any problems with it since I first got it. I honestly cant think of something this phone cant do. This phone has everything!!!"
10577,Love my iPhone. Don't think I will ever change to a different type of phone. Has everything you would want and more. 
10578,It does everything and it charges quickly. i love it
10579,"I love this phone, its everything I hoped for and more!"
10580,"My Iphone 4S barely ever crashes! Unlike DROID devices, it doesn't freeze as much, although it still does sometimes. It has many features to be a good well-rounded phone. One thing I did not like was that it does not support flash. "
10581,"I love this phone. I used to be an android girl and when my upgrade came up, I didn't know whether to remain with android or switch to the iPhone. I'm so happy that I did switch! I can never go back to android. iPhone for LIFE!"
10582,"I love my phone, problem is that sometimes my apps crash. Also sometimes my messages say they don't' get sent, but they do... so that's annoying. "
10583,"I have been on and off of having an iphone for a year now. i tried android for a while but once i got my iphone 4s, i now know that i will never go back to any other type of cell phone! the iphone does everything you need it to and never gives me any problems!"
10584,"This is a great phone, my brother and father are on them non-stop and use them for anything and everything they can possibly think of"
10585,"I've owned a few IPhones in the past and found myself running back to android every time. I thought that having the Iphone 4 would keep me happy and it didn't, I pre-ordered it when it came out and kept it for two days before returning it. Never again will I go back to Iphone.
It's a very limited phone with a small screen."
10586,"My fingers are kind of too big for it, or maybe i haven't gotten used to it yet. but it does work faster and smoothr"
10587,This thing is easy to use fun to play with and I don't think it doesn't do anything. I will always own an iphone. 
10588,"I love my iPhone. It does everything that I want a phone to do, and is fairly easy to use. It isn't overly complicated like other phones that I've used in the past. I intend to have mine for as long as it keeps working. "
10589,"I love my iPhone 4s! I think it is the perfect size, and not too heavy. I also love all of the phone cases available for this product! Def give the iPhone 4s an A+ :D"
10590,I love my Apple iPhone 4s...I have never looked back!
10591,I love my iPhone!!! I will never get another type of phone after having it. It is perfect in every way! Thanks apple!!!!
10592,"Great phone
and it works really fast"
10593,Works amazing for me but i upgraded to an iphone 5
10594,I love the iphone i cannot live with out it. i wont go to another phone 
10595,Even thought the iPhone5 just came out I'm just loving my 4s and there is no chance i would change it foe a while<3
10596,"It has great features, the display and OS is incomparable. "
10597,I love love love my iPhone!!!!! I could never go back to a non- smart phone now that I've experienced the amazing IPhone!
10598,Love my iPhone does everything. Great for work stuff and personal stuff 
10599,Like the camera and screen but hate the operating system
10600,I love this phone. Very easy to use and integrated with my ipad and mac book. Glad I ditched the android phone.
10601,"I will never go to any other phone other than the iPhone. I am hooked and have never looked back. I love the typing, the messaging, the feel, look, I love it all! You're not making a mistake buying an iPhone. "
10602,"When I first got the iphone I loved it but after about a week I have had so many problems with this phone, the phone freezes and the touchscreen wont work. I have to restart my phone at least 5 times a day. "
10603,"I have loved apple for years. I got the iPod Nano 2nd Generation in green and still have it. And it works great. I then upgraded to the iPod touch 3rd Generation, and then the 4th Generation. I finally was so thrilled when they thought up the iPhone because I said to my bff years ago. Apple should come out with a phone and it could be just like the iPod touch. And they did!!! iPhone 4s is great. Siri is the best invention ever!! I would totally recommend it! I know have the iPhone 4 and only pay $45 a month for it. I get unlimited talk, text, & web! Great deal! But def get one. YOU WILL LOVE IT! "
10604,"I love my iphone, ive had it for almost 2 years now. i have a son who doesn't see some family, so its great having FaceTime"
10605,There are so many great things about the iPhone 4.  It helps keep my life on tack as well as keeps me entertained
10606,"ILOVE this phone. almost everyone has one now a days and i can see why. these phones aren't just phones! You can play realfun games  search the web , do anything!"
10607,Siri really comes in handy and there are no boundaries when having an iPhone.
10608,I love my iphone 4s it takes great photos and has so many features. 
10609,I got my first iPhone shortly after my son was born.  I loved having a fast way to connect to my family while I experienced all of the things that being a new Mom entails!  I think everyone should have an iPhone!
10610,"Best phone I've ever owned
"
10611,This is great if you have to keep track of your work. Or go on business trips.
10612,I get the newest iPhone as soon as it comes out because I love the functionability of it!
10613, This is my first smart phone and while some of my friends move on to other smart phones... I still like mine. It doesn’t have as big of a screen as samsung but I think the size fits perfectly in my hand and pockets. I been using it for about 1.5 year and I am not in a hurry for a new phone 
10614,"I've always had problems with my Android phones so when it was time for me to get a new phone I chose the IPhone 4S and boy I'm glad I did. My old phones used to freeze on me, randomly quit out of an app and would freeze and stop working when I would try to txt. I've had the iPhone for awhile now and I can already tell the difference!! "
10615,I had the option of upgrading to the Iphone 5 but for the better value I got the 4s and I don't regret it. Its an amazing phone and Apple treats there customers very well.
10616,"I switched last October from a Samsung. I love my iPhone! Photo quality is great, videos aren't bad, iMessage is a plus too! Since we have Apple TV, iMac, and Macbook, syncing between devices is a breeze. "
10617,I think apple started the smartphone trend XD hahah now you cant live without smartphones XD
10618,I Have Had The Iphone 4s since the second day it was released i just love it. I spend plenty of time using it. I'm hoping to get the iphone 5 soon but i juat love the IPhone 4s.
10619,I got my iPhone about a year ago and it's amazing. I had a Samsung before (non=smartphone) but now I know that I can never go back to using non-apple products. I love the clean look of the interface and just the entire aesthetic in general. I love the selection of apps and the organization of the App Store. 
10620,I love my smartphone. I haven't had very many issues. It's functional and fun to use. 9/10
10621,This phone is great i don't think it is way different than the iphone 4 or iphone 5 but there is siri it fun talking to her and listening to what she says. This phone comes in black and white and of course my boyfriend got white. Apple never fails to amaze me i recommend it.
10622,"I love the features and options on the 4s. I really enjoy being able to push a button and ask anything and receive an answer, directions or takes me to the web if it can't be found to search. I''m disappointed in the size of the keyboard when I can't flip it on programs. I have actually just purchases another phone for this reason. Love the features, just need a bigger screen. "
10623,"I love all of my apps and how smooth the phone is. I don't like that I can't customize how my phone interface looks. Basically, if you have a lot of apple store apps / games and you don't mind the standard look of your iphone, you'll love it."
10624,The iphone is an awesome smart phone to have there is always updates for free and all the apps you have they get updates as well
10625,I had a blackberry before this phone and I wont EVER be going back.
10626,"I was the last person on earth to get a smartphone I believe, but now with my new IPhone 4S I am hooked!!! Only electronic a person needs now days!"
10627,"I had an HTC EVO before my iPhone, i did like the EVO. However when i made the switch, i was instantly hooked with the iPhone. Great apps, the camera is amazing and i have no idea what i would do without Siri! "
10628,I LOVE MY IPHONE. and i will be getting the next one. 
10629,I don't like apple. 
10630,I LOVE lOVE these apple products!!!! There's just a lot to say
10631,I am a big fan of Apple products. They're easy to use and are very reliable.
10632,I love it. doesn't break as easily as i thought.
10633,This phone has everything and is awesome in every way!!
10634,"This is by far one of the best smartphones out on the market and it really is my favorite thing to carry around everywhere. I literally can't go anywhere without my keys, ID and my iPhone 4s. This pocket size multi-tasker allows me to check my email on the go, keep in contacts with friends and family via Messages and FaceTime and allows me to play my games in my spare time. It really is an all-in-one power unit! Love it! "
10635,"After having an android for a while, switching to the iPhone was such an awesome experience. The apps are great, but I just don't like how the battery doesn't last long. "
10636,"Long lasting battery. 
Multiple iTunes exclusive apps.
Siri.
Business and personal friendly.
Enough said. "
10637,Resonantly got my iPhone 4   Its a great device  does everything yuh need n business related as well really good cant complain 
10638,"IPhone does it all.
actually all apple products, I had an iPhone 4s. I have always used apple and I currently use the iPad..but from when I did have my iPhone it was great. 
So many features.. Love the touchscreen.
Tons of apps. Overall just a great phone"
10639,I'm bored with this phone. I'm waiting to see what iPhone apple have in store next. 6?
10640,I have had an iPhone 3 and a 3GS so I upgraded to an iPhone 4S and I will never use another type of phone. Apple has done a great job with this phone . I was so happy I bought an iPad for work and of course Influenster . 
10641,I really am an Android person. however I do like some of the features on the iphone
10642,I love this phone it can do  anything. I take all videos and pictures  with it. It has a great camera. Great app selection in the App Store and very easy to use.   
10643,Got it on launch day and sold it when the 5 came out. Loved it!
10644,I got mine for christmas and I love it!!!!! 
10645,"Don't get me wrong, I love my iphone, but the glitches in the system that I have had to deal with for the past year that I have had it just make me so frustrated.  I have already had to get it replaced just because of a software malfunction "
10646,"I used this until i got the 5, it worked great, never had any problems"
10647,"My first smartphone was an Android (the HTC Evo to be exact).  I always said I would never switch to an iPhone, but my Evo started giving me trouble.  Since my cell phone carrier changed their upgrade to once every two years instead of once every year, I knew I needed to have a phone that was going to last me the full two years.  With my Android phone, I never got the new ""Ice Cream Sandwich"" update (or whichever letter of the alphabet and food they were on at the time) because my phone was considered ""outdated"" by that point, or not a priority.  I liked knowing that I would get updates for my phone each time an update was pushed and that I could count on it to be in working condition.  I also like that if I have an issue with my iPhone, I can bring it into the Apple store, where they are experts on that product.  Because there are so many different types of Android phones, there's no one store where the employees are an expert on your phone.  The iPhone is easy to use, and  I don't think I would change back to an Android now.  A lot of people complain that you can't take the battery out when the iPhone messes up, but you can reset it very easily.  There's no need to take the battery out like there is on Android.  I love the group message feature, and there are tons of apps that you can download!"
10648,Since i got the iphone i do everything on it plus thats how i know whats going on before i leave the house and start my day 
10649,I love my iPhone 4S couldn't wait to get it and now I won't give it up
10650,I absolutely love my iphone 4s. I just wish I could customize it like droid 
10651,I agree with other reviewers that I wish there were more ways to permanently customize my iPhone. But it's still the easiest to use smartphone I've ever come across and so convenient when connected to the Cloud.
10652,I have purchased my iPhone 4S months before the iPhone 5.  iam so in love with my phone I am comfortable not upgrading it. It has a great screen display. The screen colors are very vibrant . The camera is wonderful and this phone is really much just easy to use. 
10653,I love apple products and my 4s great phone...will be upgrading to iphone 5 soon though
10654,"I used to have an Android, which was clunky and slow. Sure, it had apps and did what it needed to do, but it just couldn't compare to the iPhone 4s. The apps are great, the maps are great, Siri.. well, Siri is fine. She's a little ditsy sometimes but aren't we all? The only thing that drives me bonkers is the autocorrect fails - and those usually turn into laughter anyway. Great purchase, can't wait to upgrade to the 5. "
10655,Not durable glass at all and easily damaged. screen is eye numbing and to radiant at times even when set on low brightness.
10656,Love it so much 
10657,"An iPhone is the perfect phone for anyone, from tech beginners to the tech wizard.  Easy to use, access to everything, and sleek looking exterior."
10658,I rush out to buy this phone when it came out and  I found it not to be as good as I thought 
10659,"Love this phone. Best Iphone I've had out of the 3,3GS. 
Sleek look. Nice opertating system. 
Better than an andrioid. "
10660,I've had my iphone for a couple years and I'll never go back to any other phone. I'm just in love with my iphone :)
10661,Used to have a DroidX & it was terrible. 
10662,I've always had Droid devices until my iPhone. Apple has great support and is always coming out with updates to better the Apple experience
10663,"I am on my third IPhone, and I will get a new one when I am available for an upgrade. I have loved them all. I will be getting away from Sprint and going back to AT&T, with my upgrade. I can do everything from me phone and could not imagine my life without it now. "
10664,My iphone is my favorite game int the world because you can get so many apps on it and there is also a variaty of music you can download from itunes.
10665,I never wanted to own an apple product but no I will never return!
10666,I had a iPhone there great iPhones are like mini computer  
10667,"I owned an iphonenfor over two years before I thought I'd jump on the android bandwagon. What a mistake. After a year and a half of awful androids that are glitchy and slow and unreliable, I am back to my iPhone and have never been happier. I have no problems with this phone. The apple software runs like a dream and apple market  has much better apps and a wider selection, I think. I love my iPhone. I will never go back to having a noniphone again. They might be expensive but it's worth it in the long run."
10668,"This phone is so awesome! I'm so happy to be an owner of this phone! All of my contacts, apps, photos and music in one place? = THE BEST!"
10669,"Does anyone else have an issue with battery life.  I love my iphones, but the battery life is terrible and I have tried fixes.  The battery will last maybe 3 hours before fully drained. "
10670,I love my iPhone this is the first one I ever revieved it's going to be about 2yrs I have it and I never had a problem with it. I would never go to any other phone it does actually what I want it to do/need.
10671,"I love my phone but i feel like it lacks customization , with an android its less limited"
10672,This phone is amazing! I love my iPhone! I never want any other phone other than an iPhone brand! its amazingly reliable!
10673,"Great phone to use apps, take pictures and very good quality videos.  With a Otter box cover, the phone is perfect"
10674,"I love this iPhone! I used to have the 3gs and it was super slow. This iPhone is a lot faster I love that it has the camera in the front, for FaceTime. When calls are put on speaker it is really loud. And the battery lasts a long time. I really love this phone. "
10675,This is a great phone and so far I have not seen a need to upgrade to a iPhone 5.
10676,"I love , love , love this phone,gadget,mini- computer.  It helps organize my life and entertainment. The iphone 4s has great sound quality, Loads quickly, and is durable... Oh, and Siri is nice too.."
10677,I love this phone & wont think of changing! It does anything & everything I want! I love it! 
10678,"I now use the iPhone 5, but loved the 4. It was a vast improvement over the 3, and holds most details to help me manage my daily life. I couldn't live without it."
10679,"I have wanted an iPhone since the first one came out and it was well worth the wait. Not only is it amazing, has awesome apps and can be used for everything the camera is fantastic."
10680,"I had an Iphone 4 prior to this one. There are a lot of changes between the two. It's still 16g like my Iphone 4, but the 4s moves a lot quicker"
10681,"I love this phone it's awesome! I don't own one but I had the chance of using one and it is pretty darn good , fast and slim. I love the fact that there are many phone cases for this phone and it s really a good way of expressing  your style! The only thing I hate about it is how fragile it is , you drop it once and it s gone!"
10682,"User friendly, good quality"
10683,"I love my iphone, and let me just tell you mine is not made out of what everyone else's is made out of. I have dropped mine so much and on hard grounds and it has yet to break. I do not like though how sometimes certain areas on my phone won't work. I will be hitting a app and it just won't open and I have to hit it several times before it actually pops up. Kinda annoying when I'm texting. "
10684,"Great smart phone! Very simple to use, quick and sleek. "
10685,Love iPhones ! I want iPhone 5s whenever it comes out (:
10686,This phone is amazing. A huge step up from the iPhone 3G and the 4. The front facing camera is very nice and the upgraded rear camera is fantastic. The retina display makes everything pop from YouTube to apps. The new processor is lightening fast and makes web surfing a lot easier and quicker. If you have an older iPhone or an android or anything this is a great phone to switch too
10687,"I love my iPhone. I don't think I really need Siri, though.. The only time I need the voice is for GPS and google maps talks on the iPhone 4 as well. I don't think I can have anything but an iPhone!"
10688,I like the iphone 4s siri is a cool idea great for texting without looking at the phone 
10689,"IPhone does it all.
I love all apple products, I had an iPhone 4s. 
So many features.. Love the touchscreen.
Tons of apps. Overall just a great phone"
10690,Love my IPhone ! Has everything i need
10691,"I got this phone because it was the newest one out at the time, and I doubt I'll switch for a while. It does everything I need it to and was an excellent buy."
10692,"I feel like Drake ""Started from the bottom, now I'm here"". Lol. But seriously, I'm a techie when it comes to phones, started very basic with Verizon then just had to get this LG Chocolate, then it was the Blackberry, then I was #teamandroid now it's all about the Apple Baby.  I absolutely LOVE my iPhone.  I thought it'd be a major culture shock coming from the android but it was surprisingly easy.  I was hesitant before to switch due to thinking I had to purchase all my apps...totally not so.  You find just as many free apps for iPhone as you do for android.  I don't think I will ever go back.  It's just onward and upward for me. It's sleek and stylish and does everything that I need for it to do.  "
10693,"I absolutely LOVE my iPhone! I've had many other phones and never understood what the 'big deal' was with the iPhone, until I got one myself. I will never go to another phone/brand. I can't wait to get the newest iPhone (5). The camera on this phone is crisp and clear. It has a bright flash. I just love everything about this phone!"
10694,Love my iPhone 4S before I had a blackberry and I couldn't do half the stuff I can do on my iphone
10695,It is super easy and fast to use! You can easily get to where you need to go to fast and easy.
10696,"I've had all the old iPhones. I currently have a 4S, with no interest in the iPhone 5. I don't get the new ones as soon as they come out. I wait till bugs r all worked out"
10697,"I will never go to any other phone other than the iPhone. I am hooked and have never looked back. I love the typing, the messaging, the feel, look, I love it all! You're not making a mistake buying an iPhone.
"
10698,First iPhone I have oned loved it
10699,"I'm always a little tough on phones, and usually as soon as I can upgrade I do. Sometimes I even buy phones before my upgrade just to get rid of it. I've had my Iphone 4s for over a year now, and I can't say I want to get rid of it anytime soon. It's great, everything I need is in one place. The App Store is always adding great new apps."
10700,"I thought a Blackberry was AWESOME, I had no clue how much I'd end up disliking it due to how amazing the iphone is. So glad I switched, it's several lifetimes ahead of the blackberry, nothing comes close"
10701,I'll probably never go back to any other phone. I love mine and all my apps on it!!
10702,This phone takes amazing quality pictures! And it is so easy to use! I don't understand why people need different phones!
10703,"I personally love the iPhone 4s! Not only is it sleek, it has very accurate touchscreen capability, amazing camera quality, easy for multi-tasking, and so much more! Although I wish it was more customizable without jail-breaking it there are many free apps that can help!"
10704,"I love the iphone! I hate to sound pretentious, but I could not imagine going back to my old flip phone. I have verizon and the 3G is really fast. And I love how many different apps are available for the iphone. I just wish the glass screen wasn't so fragile. "
10705,I love mine it's great
10706,This phone is a great smart phone it does everything for you.
10707,I love my iphone 4s! I have had pother phones in the past and wouldn't trade the iphone for anything else. It does so many cool things. 
10708,"What can't you do with an iPhone? It keeps me updated on what is important to me, it's light and I can buy covers to match my outfits ;)"
10709,The iPhone 4S is an amazing phone. It's been my phone for the past year and a half. I love the fact that it is so simple to use. The App Store has a great selection of apps. I would definitely recommend the iPhone.  
10710,"Great phone, wouldn't buy anything else."
10711,"I love my iPhone 4s, overall great phone. I've had almost every iPhone besides the 5, and this iPhone is the fastest from all of them. They do however do not have great picture quality."
10712,I would recommend the iPone. You can do everything. It's wonderful for teachers. From time to time teachers are stunned with great questions by bright learners and you can just whip out your iPhone to Google!
10713,"I've had my iPhone for about 2 months and I love my phoneeeeee! :) This was my first iPhone, and I can say it's amazing. I would've waited for the iPhone 5, but I needed a new phone right then. Ohwell, I'm still #TeamiPhone . :)"
10714,I use to have a android until I got my iPhone and I loveeee it so much the android put me through so much trouble and problems but I haven't had any problems with my iPhone I'm happy I got it. 
10715,"I will never understand why people are so obsessed with apple and it's ""i"" products. They are over-priced and there are always better products out there."
10716,"Best phone I've had so far. Long battery life, fast, and functional. I recommend for anyone who doesn't already have the latest model. "
10717,The first phone I had was the Iphone 4s and I did not like it at all. You can not design the user face how you really like. You have to jiail break the device are download a third party app also to do most things you have to Jail break it and when you do apple will say your warranty is void if they find out.
10718,I love my iPhone so much I'll probably never go back to a different phone! It's so great!
10719,"I've gone through I don't even know how many androids, but as soon as I got my iPhone I was loyal to apple. A must buy!!"
10720,I would have to say over other phones I have owned in the past that I will never stray away from the iPhone. We love their products and it is a very useful tool to have. 
10721,"This phone is a fantastic phone for those who want to save money and get an older model iphone. It is very fast, uses siri which is a good bonus. However keep in mind the software is a little bit outdated as far as processor etc.. now its the iphone 5. Other than the fact that it is an older model iphone, it is phenomenal, screen looks good, sound is good, very reliable."
10722,The Iphone 4s is tha bomb! I love mine and I play a lot of games on it such as Song Pop and Words with Friends! I also love the iPod on it and the photo/video quality
10723,"Before my iphone 4 i had a blackberry curve 8300. i thought that was the best thing since sliced bread! man, was i wrong. the iphone 4 is pretty incredible. I've had it for almost 2  years now and it's still working properly. getting a new phone every 2 years is a thing of the past! although it is a little slower now than when i got it, it still does it's job and works just perfect! good product! kudos to apple!"
10724,"I got my 4s for Christmas shortly after it was first released. I absolutely love it still to this day. I had the 3G before and I had issues with the phone staying connected to my Internet, battery life & my navigation on it was WAY off (I got lost several times). But this phone is now only $99 and some places like SAMs may have it as cheap as $49 with a new 2 year contract. Can't beat it!"
10725,"Now that the iPhone 5 has come out (and its successor can't be far behind), the 4S is officially a ""last-gen"" phone, but remains popular since Apple changed the connection on the bottom of the iPhone 5.  While the screen is smaller, the camera isn't as modern, and the phone itself isn't as fast as the iPhone 5, the 4S still has great qualities that make it a good choice if you don't have to have the absolute latest technology."
10726,"I started out my Apple phone experience with the 3GS.  I loved that phone.  I unfortunately dropped it and shattered the screen so I upgraded to the 4s.  I have been disappointed with this one.  Siri rarely understands me and I have so many technical problems with this one (dropping wireless, turning off, etc.) I already took one in to Apple and they replaced it, but this one has the same issues.  Disappointing because the apps are fabulous!"
10727,"I have been drooling for the iPhone for years and finally got one this winter. I love it! 

Anything you want it to do is readily available with a jailbreak. "
10728,This app was very easy to use.
10729,"Apple really was a visionary company with iphone and ipad, etc. but nowadays it is undeniable that they are falling behind in the market. Unless they can step it up with the next iphone, they will lose their fanbase."
10730,"This is my very first smartphone! My husband got it for me and I'm obsessed. It does everything! Seriously, I am on my phone 24/7"
10731,"I was due for an upgrade so my husband ordered this phone for me.At first I was skeptical,but the more I got to use it,the more I loved it.I find myself using my phone way more than using an actual computer.It has the internet,music,games,etc all in a handy device.Plus of course it's a phone!"
10732,"I still have this phone. It works great, so I'm not complaining"
10733,I love the iPhone 4s! It is user friendly and has excellent picture quality I just wish there were more apps like on the google play store..
10734,"Getting an iphone was the best decision I ever made. It is very easy to use and has so many apps.  I love that the camera/video is so easy to use, it makes capturing my son's life so easy!"
10735,"I've gone through many android phones before making the leap to the iPhone 4S and I could not be happier! Although I miss the ability to customize the look of my screen, the iPhone's ability to sync with other i-devices is very useful and I can let my son play his Autism games from his iPad on my iPhone in a pinch while waiting in long lines or doc offices. My iPhone has been a lifesaver!"
10736,I've had a lot of cell phones and this is defiantly the best. All the androids are so huge but this is the perfect size.
10737,I love my iphone. I think the 5 is really big and i like the size of my 4s. Well spent money!
10738,After receiving my iphone i realized i can never get another phone. I'm glued to my phone and i love the camera quality. Team apple for sure !!
10739,"I had a Samsung prior to the iphone got the iphone only because my children and husband had I phone and I liked the fact that we could do things together but not my choice, camera does not take pictures clear and you are limited to what you can do."
10740,I bought my iPhone 4s when if first came out. i wont ever buy any other type of phone! apple is the way to go!!!
10741,"I have an iphone 4s and i love it! besides the fact it freezes up on me, but that is because i dropped it. it is awesome.  "
10742,"It gas good signal ""I love it"""
10743,I love my 4S. It does everything I need and has good battery life. I have no interest in getting an iPhone 5. I prefer the 4S.
10744,I can honestly say I love my iPhone. But I hate that it freezes. I literally have to turn it off and then turn it back off to get it to work. 
10745,"I had an iPhone original and loved it but then it became the rage to have a Blackberry.. I switched but within 6 mths went straight back to iPhone. 
I believe I will be an iPhone user 4eva...it does everything I need and more. 
It looks stylish and in my opinion is the dogs dangles :)"
10746,My phone is great. I love it. It does everything I need it for. I'm really scared of dropping it though. Siri is fun to mess around with (:
10747,"I became an iPhone owner about 3 years ago  and will never switch to any other smartphone . They are by far way easier to use than a droid or windows phone. Siri is very helpful for those who use google on a daily basis and have a lot if questions for the world. Very simple to operate . They have a ""clean"" design to them . I would recommend a Otterbox or life proof case since the whole phone is made of glass. I drop mine on a daily basis and have a one year old son so i keep my Otterbox on mine and have 0 wear and tear on my iPhone ."
10748,"I love my iPhone! it never freezes up on me or gets slow. i receive and send messages very fast, and there are so many apps to download!"
10749,Just started having my iPhone like 6 months ago and I like it but sometimes doesn't want to work.
10750,"I purchased my 4s a year and a half ago. I love the quality of the pictures, the screen size, in addition to being able play great music. I've never had any technical problems either 

As a surprise I purchased 2 more for each of my teens!  Product well made!"
10751,Amazing tool easy user friendly
10752,I got my iPhone 3 years ago and since then I have been completely in love with it! I don't know what I did without it. I use it everyday in the daily life and it helps me keep in contact with my family on a daily basis and also help me with work.
10753,I love my iphone 4 it does everything and has an awesome camera.
10754,"I love my iPhone Black 4/s I love everything on it, it's amazing the only thing I do not like about my iPhone is that it can't hold a charge ither than that it's amazing!
"
10755,Mine became very slow after just a few weeks of use. apps often closed randomly. I dropped the phone once where the front and back both shattered
10756,I love this phone! it's fantastic!
10757,"Most people upgrade their 4s to iPhone 5 now but I'm still deeply in love with my iPhone 4S that I still stuck with this one. It's just so easy to multitask and do things, though I have battery issue but probably cause I use too many apps and text a lot while streaming the online radio too much. But this is the best smartphone I ever own so I don't wish to change it anytime soon."
10758,The iPhone 4s is a huge step up from the Iphone 4. Seri Really helps and if looking for a IPhone i would go for he IPhone 4s cause other the the different size and the camera improvement the IPhone 4s is cheaper and had the same amount of quality.
10759,I absolutely LOVE this phone. It does everything I want and much much more. I wouldn't trade it for the world. 
10760,Love this phone it does everything and it works great. i can do anything on this phone great 
10761,"All 3 generations have this phone,,, myself,mother and my daughter. Easy to use, it becomes a part of your life."
10762,So I was one of those I'm never going to own an iPhone.. I didn't want to be in all the hype. But after my phone has had it's issues and I finally needed a new one. I didn't have much money n my company has the iPhone 4S on sale n I never turned back. No issues and I love it.. Comes highly recommend 
10763,"I don't know what it is about the iPhone, but I really just have no love for it. The dummy proof interface and simple menus should be appealing to all, but I just never cared for them. Then again to each their own and if you dislike Android or Windows, definitely try out an iPhone"
10764,"I wouldn't trade my 4S for anything in the world! Fast, reliable, small enough for my liking!"
10765,I have had an Iphone for the last 3 years and I cannot imagine my life without it. I have tried to switch to Galaxy S3 but iphone has my heart!
10766,"Got it when they had the 3GS and got every second phone they've released since. It just works. The OS is so smooth, no glitches or lags. There's a little less customization, but it's things people think are cool one day but never look at again. I overall like hte phone. It works for what I need no problem."
10767,"In my personal opinion I believe the Apple ha  really improved their IPhone. Now it has a a great simple feel to it. It's Appstore is widely viewed. A lot of people would agree with me thAt the Apple AppStore is completely better then the Google PlayStore that Android provides. Bravo, bravo! Keep up the great work !"
10768,I LOVE my iPhone4s. I use it for everything. It's fast and reliable. Takes great pictures and it's got so many feature I don't even use them all.
10769,Everything about this phone is great. The camera is beautiful and focuses so well. The phone itself is very fast and never lags or messes up. 
10770,"I love the iPhone 4s because it does almost the same thing as the iPod touch 4th and 5th gen. The only thing I don't like is you have to be careful not to drop it otherwise it will get scratched, cracked, or broken."
10771,Only thing I don't like is how they all look the same. The looks are almost identical to each other. But I love the app store
10772,I used to be a blackberry user. I always needed a keyboard in order to type. I switched to the 4S last year and I love it. Apple has the BEST apps! It is actually really easy to type and the touch screen is REALLY responsive. 
10773,The 4S is all i would ever need in a phone. It does everything I could imagine! The 5 is unneccesary and i am very happy with this one and its shape as well.
10774,"I have had androids, basic phones, and Blackberry's...This is by FAR the best phone I ever owned. I recently washed it and it won't work but let me tell you, I about cried! I even had a funeral for my beautiful IPHONE"
10775,The best. All apple products are the best.
10776,"I love everything about this phone, including the number of apps available.  My biggest complaint which keeps this from being an A is that it does not work with websites using Flash.  You never realize how many use it until you have to wait to get home and use a computer to access a certain site.  Siri is not super helpful either, although I would not deduct anything for that.  She always claims not to understand me, and I have a normal west coast accent.  Maybe, she only understands a particular region or something."
10777,"Love the iPhone for its easy to use home screen. Clearly this phone was designed with form and function in mind. I've owned many Droids in the past and I would always get so caught up in all the personalization you can do and with this iPhone, you really can't do anything unless you jailbreak it. "
10778,"I love my iphone! I know that is very typical teenage girl to say, but honestly I have never had any real problems with it. The only thing to be weary about is the fact that it IS a touch screen, so if you're clumsy I'd advice you to get a good case on it!
That being said the touch screen capabilities here are amazing, you don't have to press super hard on it, to make it work which is fantastic. I love the fact that you can move the apps around and customize it to you! :)
I really just wish that this camera had HD video, as a youtuber that would have been very much appreciated! "
10779,Upgraded from 3s and couldn't be happier.  
10780,IPhone 4S was my first smartphone ever and I have loved it since it became mine. There is always something new to the phone which always keeps me interested and when my contract is over I will definitely be upgrading to the newest iPhone at that time!
10781,"My favorite phone yet! You can do so many things with this phone, play games, set reminders, download apps, listen to music, search the web. Not to mention Siri! She is a hoot. I could go on and on about this phone! "
10782,All the stuff this phone can do but theres cooler technology on other phones.  i hate the camera.  It is still a great phone though
10783,I made the switch to apple my phone never freezes its never slow and i get the software updates for free!!
10784,"Honestly this is such a great invention and of you're not sure about buying it, definitely go for it because the iPhone is worth every dollar. BETTER THAN ANDROID! :) the camera quality is amazing for a phone and is so convienient anywhere you go. Siri is fun for kids and the Internet is so much easier to use, it's pretty much like using a computer with a small screen. So fast, light, easy for texting, I could go on but definitely buy an iPhone 4s if you're considering  the camera is much better than the 4 and the system is faster, and if you don't want the iPhone 5 because its so big; the 4s is for you. "
10785,I would go absolutely crazy without it
10786,"I switched to the iPhone from a Blackberry in 2009 and I currently have the 4S.  I've heard a lot of people say they don't like the iPhone because they periodically lose everything.  I have never had an issue, but I also backup and update regularly.  I really like that it's simple to use and literally everything is right at my fingertips and I don't have to go digging around for it through folders and files.  "
10787,I switched from having the newest sodekick with tmobile which i liked a lot but the connection was ehhh so now i have AT&T an i love it a lot iphone 4s id say i like much better then the iphone 5 
10788,"I went from android to apple and I must say apple products are very easy to use. I really like the user friendly experience you have with this phone. It does it ALL, the only con is the navigation sucks!!!!"
10789,I love my iPhone. it is a lifesaver. i am constantly on it and the battery doesn't drain. it can be used for practically anything so you should definitely buy it. plus it has a ton of cute cases.
10790,I love the weight and size of the iphone 4s---would be lost without it!!
10791,"Before I became an iphone user, I wanted one so bad! I made a big mistake. The screen is too small, there is no app to block calls or texts and Apple releases new versions of their products too often for anyone to feasibly keep up when your phone co only allows upgrades every 2 years. "
10792,I honestly wanted a Blackberry and my husband talked me into an iPhone 4s. At first I didn't like it but now I love it. I use it for everything. And the variety of apps make my life so much easier. Its worth every cent!
10793,"It works great, but the Apple A5 makes it difficult, sometimes performs slow and it overheat"
10794,I love my iPhone 4S! Enough said.  
10795,"I love my Iphone so much! It is the perfect weight and there are so many cases that you can get for it! You have to get a good one though because the screens are fragile. Otherwise, this is a great phone"
10796,I take my iPhone everywhere. I literally would not be able to go a day without it.
10797,For the last 2 years I have been using the iPhone 4. I love this phone. Its so easy to use. My favorite feature is that my entire iTunes library is always with me. 
10798,"I loved it at first, had no issues, worked great. but the longer I've had it the more random issues have been popping up. nothing that makes it unusable, but the overall user experience has diminished. still an excellent device though."
10799,I've had this phone for at least two years and its been so good to me! It works really well and I think that it's very worth getting! 
10800,This Phone i like because it gets updates first before andriods.. they have better apps for free i think... and its easy to transfer sms messages..
10801,I love my iphone I will never be able to switch to a different cell phone. unless it was a newer better iphone :)
10802,"I am very happy with my IPhone. I am glad that they offer software updates so that you don't have to upgrade to the newest model in order to have the latest software. However, I feel like all the IPhone models have stayed relatively similar and I am ready for some new technology now. I would love to see a major ""facelift"" on the next model. (Hopefully a better battery life too)"
10803,Have never had a problem with it. Does everything I need it to be able to do and more.
10804,I had Android for many years before I gave in & decided to try out the iPhone. Love everything about it! Have not had one single problem with it yet. My Android always restarted itself randomly. Don't think I will ever get anything other than iPhone!
10805,Makes life so much easier! Awesome! Love my iPhone. It is really user friendly and so many great features.
10806,"I have had an iPhone since they first came out.. this is my third and I love it! There are definitely some things I would change about it, but overall this phone gets a B."
10807,"Reat phone, i like the way it works, great screen, it taes pictures easily, it has great speakers, but it cracks easily, kicks you off of apps, and takes forever to turn back on."
10808,Theres not much costumizatipn-.-  love the size 
10809,"I personally bought a Nokia Lumia 920 instead. I felt like the iPhone had too small of a screen and it was too generic. There are only two colors. The black and white. I wanted something that stood out. At one time, the iPhone was at the top of the smartphone game. Now it is really lagging behind.  "
10810,"Love this phone, hate how easily these dang screens break!!"
10811,"You can't go wrong with apples. I upgraded from the 3G to the 4s and its great. More to use, more abilities plus Siri. Awesome!"
10812,"I have this phone and really like it.  I like it because it is easy to use and I can share apps with our other Apple products.  My only complaint about it is that if you plan to have music on it, don't buy an 8gb phone because you will quickly learn that is not enough memory if you plan to use it for anything else."
10813,"Once you go iPhone its hard to go back... With that said there's of course tons of things that could be better. iPhone is no where near perfect. I yell at mine all the time, but I'd never want a different phone. I won't say I'm an iPhone expert at all, but I've had one since 2009 & it's my favorite. The sleek white one I just got is nice :)"
10814,I've had mine for 2 years and I haven't had any problems. First phone I've ever had with ZERO problems. Thumbs up apple. 
10815,I love my iPhone 4s. I had an android phone before getting the 4s. I don't miss having an android phone at all. 
10816,"Love love love it, best thing "
10817,The best on the market with my favorite music player system.
10818,I had a i phone 4 loved it was not hard to navigate .
10819,I absolutely love my iPhone 4S. I tried another phone (android) for about 3 days and had to exchange it for my iPhone. 
10820,Iphone4s is a cool phone to have..deff gotta jailbreak it and put your own twecks to it 
10821,"The iPhone 4S is one of the best phones I've had. It's fast and easy to use. It's my alarm clock, my organizer, and it keeps me company. Although its a little pricey it's definitely worth your money. The iPhone 4S is an absolutely positively amazing phone.Love love love it!❤❤❤"
10822,I absolutely love my iPhone! It is a great product that allows me to keep in contact with anything I need too. It's quick and easy at my fingertips with the app selection! 
10823,I love my iphone i don't know what i would do without it. i can absoutly everything on it.
10824,I love My Phone ...i never go anywhere without it....
10825,IOS can't compete with Android.
10826,Once you go apple you never go back. I have had two iphones the 4 then upgraded to the 4s and when eligible again i will upgrade to the newest iphone! 
10827,The quality of the phone is cheap. the screen breaks easily. spend your money else where
10828,"The phone is fast and useful but tere are a lot of things I don't like about it.. First, I got white and it always looks very dirty. Also, parts of my screen freeze so I can't always use everything. "
10829,"I was an android user before my 4s and I have never been happier with this phone, its worked well, it is durable in a good case, the only thing I wish I could get rid of is certain apps it comes with."
10830,Wow best phone in the world I own one and it works great
10831,"Works great and is very easy to use. Before I got an iPhone, I changed phone brands every time my contract came up for renewal. Now I don't even hesitate - iPhone is the right fit for me. I use it for everything from phone calls to texts to social media to photography to keeping tracking of my personal & work appointments."
10832,Love the phone! i own one right now
10833,I've had it for a little over a year and I love it!
10834,I have had this phone for almost an year now! I love it ..
10835,I love it! It works well and does what I need it to do.
10836,"I absolutely love my iPhone, It's the perfect size it's easy to use and very straight-forward. I do wish there was a little more options though I wish you could change the font or the backgrounds on different things like if it were jail-broken. I love the variety of cases there is, with other phones i had such a hard time finding cases but it's really easy now. The only downside is the battery dis quickly! Overall it's really amazing and I love it!"
10837,This is a pretty great phone. Doesn't give me close to any glitches and tells me when to update my software. Not to mention with WiFi it automatically does it for me when the new software is out. How cool is that!? keeps me connected fast with my twitter and Facebook drop screen feature. couldn't ask for me. Buy this !! 
10838,"There are a ton of new phones coming out these days trying to be like the iPhone but they never will. And if you do go with the other brand they go gout of style so fast you end up buying a different one shortly after. The apps are by far the bet and everything, like cars, are already set up to be compatible for the iPhone. "
10839,I ABSOLUTELY love my iphone!! Thy are great phones and have a wide range of features! I would never switch to a Samsung or android! 
10840,"I love my iPhone, so much to the point that I am due for an upgrade but refuse to upgrade to the 5. In the almost two years I have owned my phone I have had ONE problem. I blew a speaker, which my friend ordered and repaired for me for 13$. I also cracked my screen once and he repaired that for 25$. Screen is NOT easily cracked despite what people tell you. I have dropped my phone 1,000 times. It took falling on it with all my body weight to crack it."
10841,"Descent product but the screen broke multiple times while I had the phone, I upgraded to the iPhone 5 and have not broken my phone a single time! Also the life battery is extremely short and I found myself always looking for an outlet."
10842,"It was great, Siri doesn't understand when I say certain words even when spoken clearly. The screens are glass so they broke really easily. The phone is great! it is like I have a mini laptop with me at all times."
10843,"I'm for sure an Apple product lover, I've had this phone for a year and 1/2, once I am eligible for an upgrade I will get another iPhone.  I had an HTC EVO before the iPhone and I'm so glad I switched from a Droid.  I am constantly using my phone as my ""radio"" at work, streaming Pandora or just my itunes.  I love that it works to effortlessly with my bluetooth, including allowing me to wirelessly stream my music & my map navigation right through my car speakers. "
10844,Its a nice little phone and I'm addicted to it :)
10845,"Perfect phone do people who love apps, camera quality, and mostly anything beyond that "
10846,Good quality phone that is built well. Has great features that don't disappoint. Invest in a Lifeproof case for ultimate protection and makes the phone waterproof!
10847,I absolutely love my Apple iPhone 4S.  I've had the 4S for almost a year and I've never been disappointed with it.  The iPhone 4S was my 3rd iPhone purchase and I feel pretty confident in saying that I'm a lifelong member of the iPhone club.  I'm looking forward to upgrading to the newest iPhone really soon.  
10848,I love the I phones there fast speed great service. 
10849,"The iPhone 4S is one of the greatest phones I have ever had! I have very few complaints about this phone. I love how iPhones run so fast and so crisp! They rarely ever crash! And if they do, you're rebooted in less than 30 seconds! I also love how being an Apple device, you have a wide variety of apps you can download. Anything from games to health & fitness apps, the App Store has it all. The one thing I do not like about the iPhone 4S is that you can not expand the memory. If you buy a 16GB iPhone, thats all you're getting out of it! You can't just pop in another memory card, you're stuck with 16GB"
10850,"I absolutely love this phone. I went from a blackberry curve to an HTC Inspire (worst decision ever), to an iPhone 4s!
I love how it has a large variety of phone cases so that you can customize it to your liking and be set apart from everyone else. 
The programming on this is very good, but things could change after the new update"
10851,"I love my iPhone and all the gadgets ! Of course there are always better phones but I still love my phone. The only thing I would change is the front camera, everything else is perfection."
10852,I love the iphone 4s in white and the 32g . The iphone is the perfect phone for everyone.
10853,This phone is very durable with the proper case. Can shatter easily. Easy to use. Best companion for long trips.
10854,"The iPhone 4s smartphone is the best phone on the market to date. I had the iPhone 4s and decided I wanted to have some freedom with customization, so I switched to Samsung. I had the Galaxy SIII for two weeks before I dropped my phone by accident (from a short distance) while cleaning the screen; the LCD cracked!! I couldn't believe it! The entire screen was black :(. With the Galaxy SIII, the screen and LCD are built into one, increasing risk if you break the screen or LCD, you risk breaking the phone entirely. The repair alone was going to be over $300. I've returned to the iPhone 4s and have had no problems to date. 

I will admit that it was great being able to customize your phone with the Samsung SIII (the iPhone limits customization, if any). If you're a loyal Apple customer, stay tuned!! The new software update iOS 7 (coming this fall) is supposed to change the interface almost entirely. Yay!! The iPhone hasn't changed much over the years and I can say that we're definitely ready to evolve! "
10855,"So I received my iPhone 4S last November from Bell and I love it so much! I love all the different Apps you can get on it as well as the super clear camera. The sound quality is amazing on it,It's the best device for listening to music. Over all it's just an amazing phone and I'm so glad I got it. "
10856,"I love this phone. It's my everything all in one! Music, pics, social media, camera, apps and more! You can buy fun accessories like ceases to show your own personal style and personality. Haven't had any problems with this phone. I can't seem to put it down for long!"
10857,"I absolutely love my phone. It has been dropped, it has gone swimming, it has been through hell and yet somehow it still works. I take photos, I take video footage, I connect on all of my social media, I connect to family and friends and to the news media all with one device. This is my first smartphone and I am totally satisfied with it. I have seen many competitors but Apple is where it's at."
10858,Small not heavy durable and not any issuses to date 
10859,Love this phone I had one but switched because it broke but I'm tots getting another soon 
10860,"I've owned my iPhone 4S for over a year now, I made the large leap from Blackberrys to a touchscreen phone. First, the 4S is the PERFECT form factor and size, it easily slides in and out of your pockets, doesn't feel rediculously bulky, and has a screen that's actually useful to you. I have large hands, but I still prefer the iPhone screen because I don't have to reach as far across it. I've also never had to worry about freezing, or any serious glitches the entire time I've had it. I think I'm the only person on earth with any of the iPhone 4 series phones that hasn't broken the front or back glass. I've dropped the phone many times and it doesn't have a chip or scratch on it. In my opinion it's an very well put together phone with a quick and easy interface. "
10861,"I have been an avid iPhone user since the original. I got the 3, 4, and now 4s. Although there were not any big changes, it is still better. The use of Siri is helpful. The functionality and ease in use is still there. It is faster than the 4 and apps load a lot faster. "
10862,"Talk to text, Siri, voice commands. Definitely worth the upgrade. I live my 4s. I've had it for a while and it's a lot better then the 4. "
10863,"My iPhone 4s has been great... I do have some issues with it having static during calls and the phone thinking it is docked when it is not.  The photos I take turn out great and everything runs pretty smooth so I don't have any major complaints.  Like any phone, it is good but it could be better.  "
10864,"I've been an iPhone fan since the 3GS and to this day, I am in love with my iPhone. I upgraded to a 4S almost a year ago and I like it very much. SIRI of course is good for simple tasks and dictation when I need hands-free operation of the phone. I also love the slimmer, less bulky design and the fact that it runs much faster than the 3GS. Apps load quickly and opening more than a few apps doesn't seem to make the phone too sluggish or cumbersome. I'd say, if you're looking to upgrade and aren't interested in spending more than necessary, but still want to experience what SIRI has to offer, I'd say go with the 4S. You can't go wrong."
10865,"I can't live without my phone, this phone is great. It has everything you need."
10866,I'll never use another phone. Not unless apple comes out with something bigger and better! My iPhone does it all. I'd be lost without it!
10867,I have had my iphone for about close to a year now and i have had no problems really. I have internet i can play games if i get bored text or call anyone. 
10868,"This is my second iPhone. My husband inherited my iPhone 3G and is still using it. The product is the gold standard for phones. I am just waiting for iPhone 6 to come out and then I will consider updating.

My grandchildren love my phone and use it to entertain themselves on long trips when we travel together. "
10869,I was stuck on my blackberry because it did everything for me.the iPhone 4S does everything and then some! Definitely worth upgrading!
10870,I've had my 4S for a couple of years now. Never had a problem and no desire to switch to the 5. 
10871,I received my iPhone as a birthday present from my boyfriend. He upgraded to an iPhone 5 and gave me his 4s. I love it so much and don't think I could go back to my messaging phone. It is worth getting a data plan for sure! 
10872,It keeps you organized especially for schools.
10873,"This phone is definitely average to below average. Apple makes billions and billions of dollars and yet they can't make a semi functioning phone? Super disappointed in my iphone. It will randomly delete my text messages and it freezes all the time. I really enjoy the features of the iphone and how it is set up but at the same time it does not always function. Also, the home button stopped working on a lot of my friends iphones. Definitely considering getting a Samsung Galaxy next phone upgrade."
10874,"I've had my iPhone for about a year and love it!  I had two Droids and a Blackberry as my previous phones.  While the Droids were basically the same idea, apps are a million times better on the Blackberry!  I also love how it automatically remembers any wi-fi I have logged in with, saving me data and the trouble of manually logging in every single time.  I just bought a MacBook Air and they work so well together, the Cloud is great!  I can't see myself using anything but an iPhone."
10875,"I absolutely love my phone, it completes me. I got my iphone 4s for my birthday. I had a different phone and an ipod. Now i don't need to carry around 2 devices i can just carry one. I have no complaints."
10876,I literally don't know what I would do without it. Apple makes the best most user friendly products
10877,I seriously love my iPhone and I cannot wait for iOS 7!!! 
10878,I have had the iPhone 4 for about 2 months now. I love everything about it! Great phone to look into!!
10879,"I have had my iPhone 4S for about 8 months now, and I love it! I am completely obsessed with the apps I have as well. The downside is the battery life isn't as great as I'd like and it can be slow when not connected to wifi. Overall it's a wonderful phone and was $99 for a 16g, which isn't bad."
10880,Hands down the best phone I have ever owned! It's so smart and easy to use! I love my phone! 
10881,"Hated my android so I switched and I won't ever go back! I love my 4S! I cannot wait for the 5s to come out on next week! Battery life is amazing, durable, really easy to work!"
10882,I loved it when I first got in almost 2 years ago. I am now dying to get the 5s. I started having problems with this one once the 5 got released. I do have to say I use my phone as my lifeline for everything & this is the only one that has remotely been able to keep up with me. I don't usually make it 18 months with a phone so I am impressed with that. I just wish the battery lasted longer.
10883,"Ok, so technically I don't have an iPhone, but my hubby does... that's kind of the same thing.. right? ;) I love this phone! I love that it combines an iPod with a phone, love all the great apps that you can get, the picture quality is amazing.. this phone does everything! I'm getting one for my birthday!"
10884,I've have this phone little over a year now. Haven't any problems with it besides screen cracked while dropping it . Can't wait to get the iphone 5s ! 
10885,Great upgrade from the 4!
10886,"I absolutely love my iPhone 4s.  I've had every kind of phone that trends and this is by far my favorite.  Even switched for a time to the  Samsung Galaxy for a time and it didn't compare.  I'd upgrade to the 5, but I don't see where it adds any benefit since they both operate on the same system.  The updates are the best!"
10887,This phone is always at the top of anyone's wish list. The iPhone has made such a huge name for itself and every phone company had followed in their path. The 4s is very user friendly and offers many different options to it. With the new iOS 7 it made it even better and easier to you. All the little ad dons that's they do to it really make it desirable to the public. And the huge name that apple created for it doesn't hurt either 
10888,"Literally! I've had this phone for almost two years now (December 2013 will be two years) and it's still in great condition. I don't experience any lag or any problems at all really, and the new iOS7 just makes me love my phone more. Battery life seems fine & phone functions great."
10889,I really love my phone so much and now with the ios 7 it looks so cute <3
10890,I liked the iphone 3 and now I love the iphone 4
10891,I use my iphone for everything and some of the best pic I have ever took 
10892,"I love this phone, recently  I had to use an Android phone and hated it. It ran fast and smoothly. I always have had to restart the Android and force closing it. Love the apps as well. Can say enough great things about this awesome phone!"
10893,This is a pretty good stable phone but I don't like that it doesn't have 4G like most smart phone do so the internet is super slow. It is a great phone for beginners but if you like to customize you phone I would defiantly suggest an android.   
10894,"I've had this phone for about two years now, and it's the first phone that has lasted the entirety of my contract. I've dropped it in water, and it works fine. I've dropped it a million times, and it didn't crack the screen until this last time. It's so easy to use. I don't see a need to update to the 5. I'm definitely satisfied"
10895,I've had this phone for almost 2 years now and it works just as great as it did the day I got it!  
10896,The 4S is a great phone.  I love the pictures it takes and no longer take my camera with me on trips.   I'd have kept the 4S except Best buy offered me $165 on a trade-in for the Iphone 5 and I couldn't resist that.  
10897,I really really want this phone I have heard so many good.things.about.it..  does anyone who has this phone.have.anything.negative to say?
10898,"I absolutely love my iPhone! I have dropped it in the toilet, and in all kinds of surfaces and it hasn't cracked or broke at all!! Very durable and has never given me any technical problems that can't be solved by locking and then unlocking my phone. "
10899,"My poor phone has been put there so much with me and my little ones.  Dropped, stepped on, chewed on, etc and it is still going strong!!  Love this phone! "
10900,"The iPhone 4s is an exceptional smart phone, it is a very good piece of technology with its update to date IOS, which is very cool and new, especailly for Apple, and the cameras are great quality which I love for FaceTiming my gf."
10901,"The iPhone 4S is my first smart phone and I love it. I love taking pictures & the camera is great for a phone camera, IMO. "
10902,I am a Zumba instructor and my iPhone makes life SO much easier with my playlists. Love it. Hope to continue with apple products. 
10903,I had a 4 and upgraded to a 4S and LOVE it!!!
10904,"I've had my 4S for almost a year, and it's my first iPhone. I switched from a DROID, and I really like it. I have the white one, but I changed the cover into the mirror mind."
10905,Had this phone for about 2 years now! Has worked very fluidly and takes amazing pictures! It's very simple and easy to use even for beginners great for adults and younger teens! 
10906,Best iPhone thus far will not part with it
10907,I LOVE the Iphone!
10908,"This phone is the best. My sister has this phone and she gives me to use . The features looks, games, music everything is so gud! Love this phone. I wish I could get one of my own :( "
10909,"I bought this one since I heard the iphone5 was not better. I can check my email, play games, get apps, GPS, I love my phone :)"
10910,I love it sometimes but sometimes dislike it. 
10911,Love the phone would like a cover though its hard finding the wright one. 
10912,I got with the times and got my first iPhone Oct 1st. I can't believe how much faster and easier it is to use than my HTC POS! I really like everything about it. I found the case on Amazon for $2.77. Never buy the case from the store!
10913,I currently have a 4s and i love it! Out of every smartphone ive had this is the best! Wouldnt trade it for anything else except a newer iphone of course! #teamiphone 
10914,"I love my phone, it does everything I want it too.i live how it updates with the same software as the newer phone's. I would change it for the world!"
10915,I've had the 4s for about 3 years now & I am very comfortable with it. I don't feel the need to upgrade to the 5 or the 5s . I like the style of the 4 much better. I'm not a fan of longer phones like the 5. The 4 can do pretty much everything the new one can do. 
10916,Obviously this phone is everyone's first choice! I mean there's nothing bad I can say about any apple products. I have this phone and OMG it's absolutely the best!
10917,"Apple's iPhone 4S is not only trendy but a great business tool as well as great for social media and communication. The speakers work well in addition to the flat screen easy enough to manage. The phone is very easy to customize and if you are not happy with their options there are apps to customize further. Siri is either a hit or a miss. You may love the feature but it certainly isn't for everyone. Overall, this phone is wonderful!"
10918,I have had this phone for about a year but I still love it.
10919,I switched from a BlackBerry to iPhone 4S about a year ago and it's a decision I don't regret! 
10920,"I hated having my black berry because using the internet was so annoying and everything was so small , so once i got the iphone (4s) it was like heaven. i could do so many things at the same time ! "
10921,Soo much fun on this phone. so many app that are exclusive to the iPhone. My mom loves hers.
10922,"I HATE iphone...NOT worth the effort to move from android OS to IOS. :( the IOS is SLOW and you cannot customize anything or arrange icons around images as you can android...its also NOT durable if dropped...i have 3 kids and occasionally drop things and yea, android is much MORE durable."
10923,"I think this phone is great. great features, apps, & everything"
10924,"This phone changed my life. I have to be constantly checking my emails and this phone has made it so easy. Not to mention the photography on this is great. Very simple and iMessage is awesome. However, its fragile. I'm on my second because my power button broke."
10925,So easy and user friendly. My non technological mom loved this phone. 
10926,"I love my phone its not to big and its not to small 
its like having a secretary with you all the time "
10927,IPhone 4S was my first iPhone. I was never a big iPhone girl bc I thought I wasn't going to be able to adapt to the different program from my smart phone. I have to say it is a great phone. The keyboard is much easier for typing. And it's like a computer but a pocket size one. Great for apps. 
10928,"I had the 3G before my 4s. And I just don't care for Apple products. I hate the updates. I had my phone all backed up and lost contacts, photos, ringtones but yet it brought back stuff to my phone that was there a year ago. Really and it was a completely different iTunes account so not sure how the work and totally different phone."
10929,"I have an iphone 4, not 4s but the only difference is Siri so that doesn't bother me. I love my phone but I've not tried any other popular phones so I wouldn't be able to compare them. I'm familiar with apple products and love them though. They are very easy to use and just a great phone. I've had mine for almost a year and it still works like to always has and still looks brand new. "
10930,"Easy to use, great apps.  We have 3 of these phones in our family and they all have been very durable.  I recommend getting an otterbox for it, though, to avoid the screen from cracking. "
10931,"I've had my iPhone 4s for almost a year now and it still works perfectly, if you take care of it you won't get any damage done to the phone or scratches, but make sure you have a screen protector and a case! "
10932,"The iPhone 4 and 4S were in my opinion the most durable generation of the iPhone, however I have not used an iPhone 5s. While it is an outdated generation now, they are still incredibly sturdy and I enjoy keeping one around as my back up. "
10933,"I loved this phone at first but now that the iOS 7 came out it doesn't work as well. Apple designed iOS 7 specifically for the iPhone 5 to try to get people to upgrade to the 5. Mine was incredibly slow, my face pressed all the buttons during phone calls, and my apps failed a lot. Many of my families texts didn't come through to me either."
10934,"In my opinion, the size and weight of the iPhone 4 and 4S is perfect.  However, the software leaves something to be desired compared, if you're really a stickler for how fast something loads.  Otherwise, it's great.  If I could have the inner parts of the 5 or 5S in the body of the 4/4S, I'd take it. "
10935,My best friend!! I use it for everything!!!! I thought it would be useless to get one since I had an iPad but the two of them together is a marriage I refuse to destroy!!
10936,I bought my iPhone 4S in March this year and I absolutely loved it. Easy to use and fun to have. Made being a mom taking pictures of my boys fairly easy. 
10937,"I bought my iPhone 4S back in February right before the 5 was set to come out. I honestly have no reason to switch to the 5 or 5S/C. There are a few apps that have more capabilities on these phones, but I love the size of the iPhone 4s and don't think I'd switch until the reveal the 6. I've seen designs and if they are final, I would definitely switch to it when and if it's released. "
10938,I love my iPhone 4S but after a year I'm kinda getting bored of it and am thinking of switching to a galaxy.. :/
10939,"My favorite iPhone yet.  I like it better than the 5, better than the Galaxy S3.

This phone packs it all in a great form factor.  Love the glass back and the aluminum sides.  Very durable.  Phone is FAST."
10940,"IPhone has changed the way I see cell phones! I love the easy and understandable operating system. Easy for all ages! I love how Apple gives iPhones updates even though they are the past generation so they can keep up with the current trend. I recommend this phone to anyone who wants a good looking, easy working phone!"
10941,My boyfriend has the 4s while I only have the 4. And his 4s seems to be much quicker and just better in general. And also the nice thing with the 4s is you have siri. So you can get help and be a little entertained depending on what questions you ask. 
10942,"I love my iPhone. For a minute I thought about trying the new Galaxy, but I would never want to switch to Android. I may upgrade to the newer iphone, but this is a GREAT phone! I just like the bigger screen of the newer one."
10943,"I love my iPhone and couldn't live without it. I use it for my social media, staying in contact with my friends, keeping track of when I work and important dates and the many apps that come along with it."
10944,It is a great phone!! I really like the fact that I can't connect it with my other apple products!! 
10945,I love my Iphone! There are tons of apps you can download to do all kinds of things! I have a lot of music and movies on mine.
10946,"I've been having my iPhone 4S for about 3 months now, and I am completely in love. I previously had a Droid Pro from Verizon, and I am so happy to have made the switch from Android to Apple. I thought that I would have trouble adjusting from the touch screen+keyboard style, but I caught on quickly to the full touch screen. I use it daily for texting, games, audio books, and social media. I also like how it is compatible with my MacBook Pro and iTunes to easily update things."
10947,I've had my iPhone 4S for over a year now and I've had no problems what so ever! I absolutely love my phone and I'm happy I got a 4S.
10948,I love iPhones ! These phones are great. I have tried using other phones but I always come back to my iPhone. They are expensive but worth it.
10949,"My entire life is on this phone, pictures, calendar. I keep track of work schedules and need it with me at all times when on call. Has not failed me yet! I will never switch to android or windows. "
10950,"The iphone is a great phone, but my excitement since receiving it ha fizzled.  The performance is slow and I'm not sure if its the phone itself or if its the apps I am using.  The phone is awesome, just not sure if its worth the price that Apple is asking for.  "
10951,"I used at have a blackberry and hated it, however I now have a iPhone 4S and I love it. I can go on to the internet quickly so I can go on Facebook and other social media sites. Also you can get loads of different phone cases so you personalise it."
10952,I have had my iPhone 4S for about a year now. I used to have a blackberry and was not too pleased with the quality of it. I absolutely love my iPhone and I will never switch to a different kind of phone. It has been so reliable and I have never had a problem with it. 
10953,I love that it as SIRI and its so much faster! Iphones are amazing but the 4S is my favorite. Its a good size and has good storage. Awesome in every way.
10954,"Love it, I have not had any problems with my iPhone so far. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that is looking to purchase a phone."
10955,I had this phone for 2 years and now it's retired and has about 60 games for my kids on it and it doesn't have a case or anything and has never cracked or froze up bad or anything! 
10956,"Love this phone got this on sale at Sprint for $50, they r going on sale now because more iphone are coming out. So go grab yours!!!!! 16g perfect"
10957,Clearly the iphone5 is out now so obviously it's not the best phone out there. But I do wonder if the Android phones are better... I like mine and I'm happy -but i opted for only the 8G so it gets frustrating to have to keep removing pictures and videos off my phone regularly to save space. 
10958,"I guess I went into it thinking that it was some extremely fascinating phone and it wasn't. My battery never stayed charged. I was always having some sort of problem. I didn't like the fact that things that used to be exclusively for people with iPhones were now available to others. Maybe I will go back in the future, but not right now."
10959,"I am a busy mother who is employed full time and is a part time student.  I would not be able town keep everything straight If it wasn't for my iPhone 4S.  I use to coordinate schedules, pay for the kids lunches, pay bills, check email and Facebook and generally stay up to date. There are millions of apps available to help control my crazy life and the iPhone can keep up with men. I don't know where I would be without my phone........probably not in the right place :-) "
10960,"This baby has everything that I need on a day to day basis. I find that it still has great battery life, and it doesn't seem to have software problems, Internet is fast enough for me but I think that has something to do with my provider. Good buy, good phone, and its lasted a while, about a year and a half, without any real problems."
10961,Ive had this phone for a little under 2 years and I love it. I haven't had any issues with it at all. I love that it automatically syncs with my imac and updates my calendar and music without me having to do anything! 
10962,"At first, I really really really loved this phone. I thought the concept of Siri was fun, and really enjoyed it. However, the phone has glitches and my home button literally fell out. I turned on Assistive Touch (Thank god for that!) But, it's still rather disappointing!"
10963,"This is the best phone ever. I love mine, I've had it for almost a year now. It was a replacement for a galaxy that got stolen and I really didn't want another galaxy. Too glitchy. But I was definitely impressed with the iPhone :) Love Love Love It :) <3"
10964,"I love my iphone! Its a great phone, better than android. Apple has better games than android and more of an app selection. The only thing I don't like is the new ios 7 update. It makes things complicated sometimes. Other than that its a great phone. ITs got an awesome camera, built in flash light so you don't have to download an app, and all your music gets saved to iTunes."
10965,Both my parents fell for the iphone gimmick and hate them. They don't hold a battery charge at all and break very easily. I have had both a android phone which I loved and now have my first windows phone which is amazing. Plus Iphones always make you upgrade and go out of date other phones never do that.
10966,"I've had this phone for almost a year now and it hasn't broken, it still runs fast and i think it'll last for years to come, unlike other devices I've had before which broke down on me 3-4 months into purchasing them!"
10967,"I can't live without my iphone. Had it for almost two years now. I do everything on it from emails, web browsing, watching tv, games, writing notes, & etc. however lately I have started noticing it being slow crashing I think it's all because of the new iOS 7 ."
10968,I've had this phone for almost two years (in may) and I haven't had one single issue. With any other phones I've owned issues started to arise before the one year mark was up. Not my iPhone! I will forever own an apple phone. Simply the best.
10969,"I honestly love this phone . I'm always using the Siri to text during class , to ask questions , absolutely anything . This phone is smaller than the most resent phones & it's better that way . "
10970,"I absolutely love the 4s. I don't see anything wrong with it and honestly don't want to trade up for the 5, or have any intentions on doing so.
I've never had anything wrong happen with my phone other than when I plug it into my computer to charge, sometimes iTunes doesn't pop up - but that's more so my computers problem aha - so yeah, love this phone!"
10971,"I have had a lot of problems with the iPhone 4s. Just to be blunt, it has pathetic battery life, frequently overheats. I had the battery replaced just about a year after buying the phone, and the problems persisted, indicating it's a more significant design issue."
10972,"This is a good phone, not a great phone. Its just more attractive, design wise, but I don't feel that this is THE phone to have. I'm considering to switch to the Galaxy"
10973,Made my life much easier in many ways. Apple's user friendly interface didn't take me long to get familiar with the iPhone. Would definitely recommend it to anyone who would like to start off using a smartphone. 
10974,My Iphone the best phone I ever had the camera not great but it works good I love smartphone I had my for year and half and look like I just got it.
10975,"It was everything I wanted in a smartphone and more. I had this for awhile and was very pleased with it.
I paid $45 for a 32 gb and no problems. Just this December I got the 5c with applecare.

Little advice, if you get an apple phone, get apple care. xxo"
10976,"I've had my iPhone4s for around 5 months and I love it very much. I have my life practically saved on that phone. The battery life was nice during the first few months I had it, but it has slowly gotten worse and worse. I am constantly on my phone and I use it to stay organized and it was a very nice investment. "
10977,I loved the 4s! I did not have any issues with it at all.  it was the 3rd iphone i have had and I only traded it in because I received a great trade in deal for the 5s
10978,I had this phone for a long time and loved it but my screen was so small that my son couldn't play any of his learning games without clicking on the ads. It is a great phone but I switched to the Samsung Galaxy S4 and love that much more.
10979,"I got this phone about 6 months ago, I love it. I have everything stored on my phone. Apple is by far has the tech than any other phone.. The only thing that i think can be better is bigger screen! I will never own another droid!"
10980,"I would say not the best phone right now in the market but its sufficient enough to do what you need to do like checking all of your social media outlets and checking nail.
The phone eventually will start to get slow and it can be very annoying"
10981,I've had my iPhone for 2 years and it's lasted me longer than 2 of my parents phones have lasted them. It comes in handy from everything from banking to even a flashlight. It also has a very great camera. 
10982,"I love the look of the iPhone 4s.  It has a lot of the daily items that I need.  However, it has a lot of glitches and some apps can have over one gigabyte of memory."
10983,"I love this phone. i wish they made the screens better because everyone that has an iphone ends up with a cracked screen. Everything is simple and easy to use, much easier than using an Android. "
10984,"ILove Apple IPhone.. It does everything that I want a phone to do, and is fairly easy to use. It isn't overly complicated like other phones that I've used in the past. also had a very great camera. :)"
10985,"This phone is my left arm to meee, i never leave without it anywhere even if i don't have it with service its also a great phone for wifi access and also for iPod lol, but i never had a problem with this phone i lve the cases there soo many to choose from there so many accessories for this phone iphone 4  overall I'm never giving this phone up its amazing "
10986,I had this phone for a good while and it was a really good phone. The only problem I seemed to be dissatisfied with was the volume. I think they could be louder.
10987,"For the short while i had this phone i absolutely loved it. it worked so well, and i loved all the storage space it had and i loved i could use it as an iPod as well. definitely a good product"
10988,I like it at first but after only 3 dys the screem cracked when I had itbin my back pocket. I probably shoukd have bought the otterbox to protect it but now I have the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and am pleased. 
10989,It is a pretty cool phone to have and use. Apps are easy and convenient. Must say that newer versions are huge improvements though
10990,"I absolutely love my iPhone. I've had it for almost 5 months now, but I haven't found anything about it that I don't like. My service is pretty great and it isn't too expensive either. I would recommend it to everyone wanting a smartphone. I've heard a lot of people say they screen cracks rather easily, but I bought an Otterbox and its protected it well. ( I've dropped it 100 times and not even a scratch.)"
10991,I LOVE my iPhone 4S. Siri is wonderful and you can have weird but funny conversations with her. She also can set up events for you in your calendar and reminders. The iPhone 4S runs very smoothly. I'd recommend this phone to anybody! With the new update to iOS 7 the battery does tend to drain a little faster than before.
10992,The only reason why I give the iPhone 4s a 'b' rating is because of the screen.  It is so easy to break the screen on the iPhones.  You would think as much as we spend apple could come up with a better design.  
10993,I used to love the iphone until the update of ios 7 that has been the down fall of the phone. I'm also not a fan of the short battery life.
10994,"I love the iPhone 4s. It was a tough call when I purchased it between the iPhone 4s and the iPhone 5 but after careful review of each I realized that iPhone 4s had all I needed and was much more affordable. 

Great touch screen. Doesn't need repeat touching, sliding or finger punching. 

Very few free apps, but many apps have a 'lite' version to try it out. 
"
10995,"I love iPhones, and while the 4s is great mine does have a few issues.  For one the battery needs to be recharged often, more often then I would like.  Second I keep having to restore it because it says the memory is all used when I know it is not, it says I have 9 gb in apps while I only have 2gb.  still the amount of things this phone can do is amazing and it receives a b+ from me.   "
10996,I like the iPhone 4S because I am a real big fan of iPhones and Apple devices. Also I love siri it is really helpful for any situation you are in. I like Apple apps better because they are more fun then android apps. Plus iPhones last longer then android phones the iPhone never lags and iTunes has all the best music and top hits if you decide to get a phone then you should get an iPhone4s. 
10997,Love my iphone. I've had an htc before this and used some other brand devices but I always go back to apple. Simple layout and easy to get things done on. Best way to listen to all my music. IOS7 is the best too.
10998,Ive had several different cellphones and I always seem to go back to the Apple Iphones...These are so easy to use and I have no issues with the operating system. I would definitely recommend the iphones. 
10999,"I loved my iPhone 4s, and I kept it for a little more than two years before upgrading to the 5s. It stayed in great condition the entire time. I was able to get $200 trade in value toward my new phone even after those two years."
11000,I used to love the Apple I phone 4s until the generation 5 came out.Apple makes it virtually impossible to keep up with this phone series without having to purchase the latest. Ever since the 5 came out I have had issues with apps closing in the middle of something due to the 4s not being capable of hosting the latest updates. Such a bummer. 
11001,I love my iPhone 4S! It works great. Still learning all the bells and whistles. The apps help make this phone great. Everything is inter grated nicely. 
11002,Great iphone in the iphone family..but it dosen't playwell with googleglass. If you are considering getting googleglass then get an android phone. Apple keeps their IOS locked up and criples your GG.
11003,"Doesn't connect to network well, terrible battery life, and too expensive and tiny screen and totally impersonal. "
11004,LOVEEEEE my iphone 4s it is amazing and fits me perfect. I was so skeptical of ever getting an iphone and once i got this i was in love with it. Very easy to use. Love the screenshot function. Pictures are amazing what more can a girl ask for. 
11005,"It took me forever to jump onto the Iphone band wagon, but let me tell you, I am SOO thankful that I did. I don't know what I would do if I didn't have my phone. Being able to literally have everything with you at all times if one of the best things ever. There are so many different apps that you can buy or download. Literally an app for everyone. It is perfect for all of you who are addicted to social media like I am lol."
11006,"It's an iPhone, I love it, duh!  The 4s was my first ever iPhone after having been an Android lover for a long time.  I have had mine almost 2 years, no complaints!  I do wish it was faster (my husband has the 5, so I now know mine is not as fast as it can be haha).  I have the 16g, which I thought would be plenty of space... and it is if you don't use your phone for music.  I use mine as a camera a LOT, and have tons of apps.  I have read about the screen shattering - if you haven't learned by now to keep your phone in a case, then you're a moron.  Invest in a decent case, you'll be fine.  My 10 year old has had her iPhone 4 for a year, if she can take care of it, so can you!  The iPhone also has the most cases made for it ever!!  If you like anteaters, there's a case for you out there with anteaters on it."
11007,"Absolutely love this iphone id be lost without it its my camera video recorder, laptop and phone all in one"
11008,"I love the iPhone 4s. It's easy to use, includes great apps, and it's quite durable. My 3 year old loves the interactive games that are available."
11009,"I used to have androids but I couldn't stand the lag so I finally broke down and bought a iPhone & I'll never own another device till Apple either goes under or stops making iPhone. The phones are smooth easy to use, very small fits in your hand perfect, takes amazing pics etc overall great phone   "
11010,"I had an iPhone 4, not a 4s, for almost four years and finally decided to upgrade when the 5s came out. I was hesitant because I didn't know if the upgrades they made would be significant enough for me to see a big difference. I can see a BIG difference. The processing speed is beyond good, the screen is excellent, and iOS 7 works nearly flawlessly on my phone. The only downsides - the fingerprint recognition doesn't always recognize my thumb and it may take several attempts to get it right and the battery life isn't as good as it was on the 4. If the screen were about an inch bigger diagonally, then I could do a lot more with the phone and not have to switch back and forth between that and my iPad or computer.  But I still love my phone."
11011,I love this phone. Simple as that. I plan on upgrading in June to an iPhone 5S because my 4S is a refurbished and one of the speakers doesn't work but I still love it.
11012,"I like my phone, it's got options and is easy to work for people like me! It's not too smart for me and has just what I need."
11013,"While the 4S is a good phone, nothing compares to the newer ones. The 4S is really heavy compared to the newer ones. And of course, the screen is smaller."
11014,"I started out with an iphone as my first real smart phone, and then somehow got talked into using an android phone when it came time for an upgrade. I personally hated the android operating system. Iphone is very user friendly and I just prefer it overall. Back with iphone again and I love it! "
11015,Very great phone I love how simple apple products are. I don't like how small the screen is but all in all I love the phone. 
11016,"I find all Apple products incredibly easy and simple to use. Although this is not the latest iPhone out there I'd still recommend it, there is not a huge difference between the 4 & 5"
11017,I love this phone and honestly wouldn't trade it for another phone unless it's the iphone 5. I think this phone is really easy to use and just not too heavy like other phones but if you update it to ios7 and if it is an old phone it will lag on you.
11018,"The iPhone 4s is a pretty easy phone to use, whether you're a beginner with smartphones or someone who has had one for awhile. The battery life is what I'm most impressed with- I can go about a day and a half without having to charge it, something almost unheard of in today's world of smartphones."
11019,"I love my iPhone 4s, but 8gb is almost not enough. With 8gb you cannot download a lot, so if you use a lot of storage than I wouldn't get an 8gb. The battery life isn't great either. I like the iPhone, because I can use apps like Instagram. The iPhone has great sound, and has amazing picture quality. "
11020,"I use to have an iPhone . It's a very easy phone to use.i really enjoyed the apps that were on the phone. But, the 8gb was very small and was used up really quick."
11021,"I love my phone. The only issue that I have is with the new update I can no longer add someone to my favorite contacts. The phone is small and fits properly in my hand unlike the Iphone 5, which is to big. Just do not use it while it is on the charger because it will get extremely hot."
11022,I love my I phone. It was awfully easy to learn how to use it. I took a class from Verizon and it was so helpful. When it is time to upgrade I will get another. 
11023,I completely love my iphone4 I wouldn't trade it for anything. I've had mine for almost 1 1/2 years and it's just as good as when I got it!  I've dropped it in the toilet while doing my hair (knocked it off the sink) and I put it in rice for a few days and it's just as good as it was before I dropped it! love em!
11024,"I have had my phone for 10 months and I'm not a big fan of it anymore. The iOS7 has made my phone mess up quite a few times. I was in love with it when I first got it, not so much anymore. I have to admit that it is simple to use. Any one could use it."
11025,"I had my IPhone 4s for 2 years and it broke 4 times, only one being my fault, the rest due to bugs in the programming and it would just stop working so I would have to get it replaced. I loved my phone, it was great. Easy to use, had great speakers, but had to many bugs and only apple would fix it."
11026,"My 64 GB iPhone cost close to $900 when it first came out, and the first one lasted me about a year until it suddenly decided not to turn on any longer. Luckily, Apple quickly responded and sent me a replacement. The replacement also, lasted about a year because having an assortment of problems such as short battery life, apps crashing, rebooting on it's own. I'm not so sure I want to go and get the iPhone 5s if this will continue. With premium priced cellphones, I expect premium quality that should last well over 12 months. I do like the simplicity of Apple products, and I am exclusively only buying their computers. "
11027,I love my phone. Works great. Apple apps are secure.  The best thing about this phone was that it was free through a Verizon contract.  I just recently updated my phone and I had the choice of the iPhone5 that was 200 or the iPhone4 for free with a two year contract. 
11028,My children all had this phone that is a total of 4 I had to replace them at least twice for each child. They break so easily! The back and the front would crack. They still enjoy the apps that the iphones offer and they never had a problem with the system until the update. I switched from an Android to an iPhone I returned it within a week. 
11029,IPhone 4's can be very handy but they constantly freeze and can be very slow while downloading stuff.
11030,My sister loves this phone. It is easy to use and is great. The only thing is that it has the battery inside and you are unable to get it out.
11031,I actually got my first smart phone 3 weeks ago and it's a iPhone 4 so far it's ok but I would of prefer the galaxy 
11032,"I have had my iphone 4s for a little over a year now, I like it as far as the features go. I mostly just make calls, text, picture texts, and browse the web. I didn't like how many issues came along with the iOS 7 update, caused a lot of problems on my phone such as my phone gave me unacurate battery percentage so my phone would die periodically. Also there is a glitch that has never been fixed even prior to iOS 7 and that is that my phone asks me several times a day for my iCloud password which drives me nuts. I will say I love the slimness of the phone, the fact that it's not plastic and that it has a pretty good camera. This probably won't answer all your questions but hope its helps.  "
11033,"I think smartphones are one of the best things invented & I absolutely love my iPhone! I have to say I'm a little biased since it's really the only smartphone I've had but I figure why try others when I'm so very happy with this one??  You can do just about anything with it with all the apps available so while I may not talk on it very much I do use it constantly. It definitely keeps a person with some A.D.D. issues entertained. I love having the internet at my fingertips at all times, being able to check Facebook, read, play games, have maps at my disposal, music, you name it! There's of course the camera so I find myself snapping pictures quite often to share or just have for memories. No longer do I have to be sorry that I don't have my camera on me when I'm on a walk & have a perfect opportunity to capture a picture of a dragonfly at rest.... one of the best pictures taken:-) It's compact & packs a wallup! I totally feel lost if I ever leave it behind or the battery dies out."
11034,"Really it was flimsy and the second I dropped it  had a huge crack in the screen. personally I think I'll stick with a galaxy, but it is a good app phone."
11035,The phone is great when you first buy it. Make sure you have screen protectors and a case or it will break. But when there is a problem its very hard to fix. I can't put music on there anymore and I have yet to figure out why. 
11036,"I had the iphone since it first came out, I even have the original model sitting on my desk. I love it and I will never switch to a galaxy or whatever. So #teamiPhone "
11037,"I have had VERY bad experiences with cell phones since I have owned one.  Since I have had the iPhone 4S I have had much fewer issues.  The only problem I have had is that sometimes my photos will not save, they will sometimes be a white space instead.  Otherwise I totally enjoy the emojis, the app store, iMessage, etc.  And the camera is awesome!  "
11038,"I recently upgraded my phone 4s for more memory, I love this phone. It has all the things I need to use on a daily basis. I use my phone for everything, including working out, waking up for work, jamming out.. and some much more. I have not had any problems with my phone what so ever. Excellent phone.  "
11039,"Unfortunately it's only an 8GB phone, but other than that, I love my phone so much. Other than frequently deleting apps, pictures, ect, I haven't had any problems. When there's a small issue with a certain app, or function on the phone, there usually quickly is an update resolving the problem. I definitely would recommend this phone."
11040,"I've had my iPhone 4s for 1 1/2 years now, and it has been through so much and I only deal with minimal glitches when changing applications. I've dropped it countless times, and even left it outside in the rain for 10+ minutes and it worked perfectly fine the next morning. I can tell the battery is starting to go, but that's expected like any other phone. "
11041,"Yes, I named my iphone Stella LOL. I never leave home without my phone. I love customizing the way it looks, changing my case and even making my own cases. I will never go back to android again! #teamiDevice"
11042,I had my iphone 4s for about two years and i loved it . never broke or had any issues with it until i haven't it on top of my car and it flew off when i was driving . i recently switched to the 5c due to switching phone companys and i would rather kept my 4s
11043,"I have had the iPhone 4s for about 2 years. Overall it has been a great phone. The only problems I have with it is that the battery life is horrible and if you get the standard 16g, it runs out of room very quickly."
11044,"This is the best phone I've ever owned. I have it through Verizon and the service is amazing. You can pretty much do anything and everything on the phone. Love all the apps, love Siri (I always use it to set reminders), I will definitely be sticking with iPhones from now on. Great picture quality, I've pretty much stopped using my actual camera since I got this phone. Though the pictures with low light are a little grainy. "
11045,"I love apple this smartphone is easy to use I have 2 years with it and have no problem at all, I totally recommend if you are planning to switch to another cellphone... 100% recommend it"
11046,"I have always been an android girl. Apple has never been my friend, but recently I got curious and decided to cross over to the other side and got myself a shiny new phone. I fell in love. While the screen is smaller than what I am used to (I had a Samsung Galaxy S2) I definitely like the ease of the phone. I have no lag, everything runs smooth, its amazing. I truly don't see myself ever going back. I think I am addicted (:"
11047,I really enjoy this phone - it still works great and I've had it just about two years now. I take good care of it and love the size of this one! I'll miss it when I have to let it go!
11048,I had this phone for two years. I love the lightness and the color choices they had. I chose the white because I thought it was better than black since I had that color for the 3 already 
11049,"I love my iPhone and it's user friendly everything. I've had my 4s for a few years now and it was great when it was new, but now that there have been two, almost three new additions to the iPhone family, it seems that my programs tend to have more ""glitches"" than the new ones.

Also, the glass screen makes it a must to purchase a life proof case if you are a constant phone user/mom. My last two phone were shattered by my kids.

Overall, very happy with it still. Siri was a fun addition, but I look forward to the new ones with the bigger screens and better cameras."
11050,"I have always wanted the newest phone. Always. This was the first phone that I've had and did not care to have the next model as soon as it came out. I've been told that the 5 is night and day in comparison, but this gets the job done and until I have to, I'm not upgrading."
11051,This phone lasts so long! I have had mine for about four years. I love it. The screen breaks really easily though.
11052,"Ok so i really like this phone because its just easy to use. I like an iPhone better than an Android. I'd recommend it to someone, just if you're going to get one of these get some sort of good screen protector."
11053,"I had the iPhone 4S and LOVED it! I recently upgraded to the 5S and kind of wish I would've just gotten a new 4S. Don't get me wrong, the 5S is great too but, as with any new model, there are bugs to be fixed and I never had any issues with my 4S."
11054,"This is a good phone! very durable and long lasting! i plan on always having an iphone, apple  offers great products! worth every penny!"
11055,I have this phone since it came out I absolutely love it. I have never had any problem with it. I recommend it a 100% 
11056,"I've owned this phone since it came out and i love it, i like how easy and fun it is to use and never had any problems with it!"
11057,I love the I phone 4s it is so awesome I love it you should buy this phone i have so many games but when I first got the phone I thought it was a regular phone then i started to use it more often and then I got the hang of it!
11058,Just got this phone after have the Samsung Galaxy 3 have to say this phone is way better. The galaxy was very glitchy. I miss the screen size of the galaxy but I'll get used to it.
11059,I have this phone.It worked great at the beginning but it does have some stuff wrong with it.It turns off by itself.The texting freezes up at times.I cant get all my texts.
11060,I went through 3 of these within one year. All of them died from some type of hardware failure. The only good thing was the warranty and the customer service from the apple store!
11061,"I had an iPhone 4s for two years and it went through hell but it never broke! I love the software, and apple in general!"
11062,"I have had my phone for two years now and I just love it.  I am able to talk, text all at the same time.  I love the apps that I am ale to get on my phone.  Just Love it."
11063,"I don't really care for my iphone anymore, the phone itself gets extremely hott and burn my hand.. I would rather have a Galaxy s5  "
11064,This would make a fantastic first phone for a young teenager. Its user friendly and very durable. However it is a little small in my opinion.
11065,"I've been stuck with an Android (which I HATE) since I have gotten a smartphone, so when it broke and I could upgrade for free to the 4S,  I was STOKED. And I love it! Very user friendly, great apps, great camera, I love that I can make ""Siri"" a British man (mmm...) and there are so many cute cases! Overall, it's pretty much perfect in my opinion "
11066,"I currently have a iPhone 4s and I love it. Minor things are annoying with it, but I can deal! I must have my phone. It's like my baby <3 The apps crashing are most likely caused by the app, and not the actual iPhone itself. The battery life also depends on the settings of the phone as well as what you're running 24/7. Ex: weather, email, facebook, snapchat, etc."
11067,"This is a great smartphone for beginners,  the way the system runs is fairly easy and very smooth.  The phone has tons of apps, battery life is fair. screen is kinda small in my opinion but is very good phone overall."
11068,I wanted an iphone for the longest time and finally got one less than a year ago. It is definitely my favorite phone and I plan on continuing to use it as long as possible. It is easy to use and I would choose it over another phone any day. 
11069,I love my 4s!! A lot of people have gone with the new 5s or 5c but I still am just completely satisfied with my 4s. I won't be switching for awhile. 
11070,I am infamous for having my blackberry or droid break.  I am going on 2 1/2 years with this phone & have had ZERO issues! Well worth the money! Once you go iPhone you will never leave
11071,"Got this a few years ago and still to this day I have it, never had to have it repaired.. although I have had one problem with it and I have researched and this had happened to other people not just me but my vibrate switch had stopped vibrating for some reason and it was because the vibrate motor is stuck down with tape and the tape was either dirty or not stuck down so I had to run this app called Ibrate to get the motor running and it's fine now, not as powerful but what can you do. Good phone to get! battery life is amazing!"
11072,After having a Samsung Galaxy S2 for 2 years i finally switched to a 4s. The phone works perfectly and the app store is great! I have not had any problems with it yet and it is very easy to control. The camera has good quality and they battery lasts a very long time compared to my galaxy! 
11073,"I have used both i phone and android before i like iPhone because it has a lot of different apps to use like the voice command. but i all so like android because all most ever app you want you can get for free and don't have to go buy cards just to buy music.
  so all in all i would pick some thing different than an iPhone "
11074,"I used to be an android user,and don't get me wrong,I do miss all the customization. But as of now I have been really content with the Iphone 4S. "
11075,"So don't ever break your screen. Apple apparently ""can't take the screen off and replace it, they only do that for iPhone 5"". Seriously irritated that even if you go to another place to fix your screen, they will no longer service you at the apple store. It's complete bullcrap. I had to purchase a brand new phone because they wouldn't fix it. Stupid Stupid Stupid. This company basically runs the world and won't even fix a damn phone screen because they are money hungry. If i didn't just pay $300 for a new one I would switch to android. I honestly will if i break this phone again. "
11076,"Although this is the older version of the iPhone now-a-days, it still works like a champ. I have only experienced one issue with this phone, and it was Siri not understanding what I said. But what do you expect for the first round of Siri. No matter what, this phone was still top dog in it's day!"
11077,I enjoyed my iPhone 4s. Easy to hold in hand easy to fit in pocket very convenient..love the simplicity of using the iPhone 4s
11078,"I wasn't a huge fan of Apple when they made the switch to this type of design. I didn't care for the look or feel of the phone, didn't like the squared edges because they were always getting dents in them quite easily. I had one of my iPhone 4's mic randomly stop working, so that when I was on the phone I either had to have a headset in or have it on speaker, and another had the back glass crack while I was holding it in my hand! All in all, it's still an apple product but I didn't care for this model. "
11079,"The iPhone4s starts slowing down overtime, but works for me even though it's kinda slow. So far my power button broke about 1 and a half year later and so did my 2 other friends not sure if it's a thing or we just clicked the power button too much?"
11080,This phone is amazing! I love everything about it. If you are unsure on what smart phone to start out with and you are unfamiliar with the android system because of the complexity of it..... you can not go wrong with the iphone4s. Siri is wonderful and has information as soon as you ask. A+ in my book!!! 
11081,"I loved my iPhone 4s, it syncs easily with my iTunes and iPad. The only downfall with the 4s is that it did not offer LTE, which is why I upgraded to the 5. The 4s has exceptional battery life as well. "
11082,"I have had my white iPhone 4S for almost 2 years now and it is the only phone I have ever been satisfied with for a long amount of time. I love everything about the 4s, its sleek look, apps it provides, and its easiness to navigate."
11083,Previous to this one I had another iPhone but this one I love I have had it for 2 years 3 months and so far no problems really good phone and with Siri to help 
11084,"I love how quick and easy my phone is. I have had my phone almost 3 years now, and my only complaint is my battery life is not as long as it use to be, when I upgrade to a new one it will be for another iphone."
11085,"The Apple iPhone 4S is an excellent phone however, if you like utilizing your phone for pictures, the camera on thus phone is sub par. I had my iPhone 4S for two years and would have upgraded to the iPhone 5S, however, because the camera was the same, I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I'm glad I made the switch but if Apple should see fit to change up its camera, I may switch back later. The camera is my only complaint about this phone. "
11086,I don't see myself getting any other kinda phone. it gets a lill slow sometimes and its crazy all the stuff you pay for. ive had it for over a year and still cant figure the cloud out ;)
11087,I am a huge Apple fan and love the mac computers but I always had issues with dropping calls and it freezing. The only thing I miss is there are some great apps not available on android. 
11088,"When I first got my iphone I loved it more than my droid. BUT as time went on I started having issues with it that I had never experienced with a droid. The internet connection was super slow even though I was running on 4G, it would freeze, I kept losing sound with videos and phone calls and sometimes I couldn't even unlock it. The only thing I like about iphones now is that they look sleek and nice. "
11089,"I've had this phone for a year and a half now. I have had my downs with this phone but in general it is great! In comparison to my last phone (a Blackberry Curve) this phone is the bomb. It is much faster and has so many apps. I am a programmer and I have written programs in this phone while I was out in the city with friends. It is a powerful and long lasting phone, the possibilities are limitless with what you can do or get out of it. I know that when the day to replace it comes, it will be an upgrade to another Apple iPhone; I have tried RIM, Android, and Windows phones and unless Apple drastically falls behind on their technology, there is no way I'm switching. It is not only a software issue for me, there is nothing near to the look and feel of an iPhone"
11090,"I love this phone. I've had it for a year and it's been great. It's like having a computer in the palm of your hand. It's great for playing games, setting reminders, business needs, and many other things. I wouldn't trade my iPhone for nay other phone. It's great and the good thing about the 4s is that it has siri and she is very helpful and fun. "
11091,This is my absolute favorite phone I have ever had. I will definitely upgrade to a new iPhone as soon as my contract is up- Best phone ever!!!
11092,"I know some people are very biased against Apple's products, I love them. They not only offer a sleek design, but they're extremely user-friendly and easy to figure out and use. "
11093,"It's difficult to change phones once you start using apple products. It's super easy to use and it looks amazing too. I wish the front and back glass is a lot stronger though. Other than that, it's a really good phone!"
11094,"I've had my 4s since the week they came out.  It's been excellent, giving me very little issue.  My main complaint is battery usage, but I've heard that the newer iOS releases are what may cause this b/c they are meant more for the newer phones.  
I will definitely be upgrading with the 6 comes out, as I find it to be the easiest phone to use and they customer service is superb.  Love my iPhone!"
11095,"Ive had my phone for 2 years, and i am absolutely happy with it. I have no need to upgrade to a 5 because all my needs at being  met with the 4s. No regrets with picking this phone"
11096,"I really love my Iphone 4S, I had a chance to switch and get the 5 but I refused. I don't see what is the big fuse. I have had it for about while now and I can't seem to change to another type of phone."
11097,"Apple products have been the best for me by far. It's easy to navigate and it looks classy too.  Overall, it's a great phone!"
11098,So for the longest time I always had some sort of Droid phone & my iTouch. Well I got tired of always having both on me so I went ahead and looked into getting an iPhone. And I do not regret it one bit! I've only had an iPhone for a little over a year now and really wish I would have gotten one so much sooner! I got mine back in May 2013 and I have not had a single problem. I've never had to take it back or take it to Apple to fix anything or replace it! I do wish I had some more space on it. It's hard to believe how fast 16GB can get used up! But I love my iPhone and am so happy I made the switch!
11099,"My first smart phone was an android, I hated smart phones. I started to ask around and found that most iPhone users loved their phones. So I decided to go for it! Best choice I ever made. Love my iPhone 4S !! And even though the iPhone 5 is out, I am not in any rush"
11100,"I jut love this phone,I currently have the iPhone 5 and I'm just in love whit it ...Smart products !!!!!"
11101,This phone was my first iPhone and I have had it for almost 2 years already and I don't't regret purchasing this phone at all. I love how I can sync all my Apple products together 
11102,"I've had my iPhone 4S for over a year now and love it! Before, I had only owned Android smartphones, and the iPhone was a huge change for me. This phone is so much more user friendly. I do want to upgrade to one of the newer iPhones, but I am completely satisfied with having this one for a little while longer. "
11103,I enjoy my 4s very much. I have dropped it countless times. I have had it for 2-3 years now. Phone still works great. It has great picture quality! I don't really use Siri a lot. 
11104,I had this phone and absolutely loved it but when I went to pick baby up it flipped out of my pocket and into water I was seriously heart broken. Best phone I ever owned.
11105,I love this phone! I've had it for a few years now and I can't be happier with it. It does everything I need and I always have it with me. The only thing I'd wish for would be a cable that doesn't break.
11106,"Plenty of phone; found that I never needed the 5/5S - like my children tried to say.  These phones have taken a beating by both me and my boys....but they keep on ""textin'"".. :)"
11107,"Lets be honest, the only phone i have had before my iPhone 4s was a razor flip phone, so of course i think the iPhone is a gift from God himself! I have had the same phone for almost 3 years now and i haven't broken the screen (although that is a possibility). overall though i really like this phone and if you're looking for the most basic iPhone that doesn't have all the whistles and gadgets this is the phone for you!"
11108,"I love owning this phone, I have owed it for 2 years and have yet to run into any problems. I have never had to have a replacement. The photo's come out nice and sharp and easy to upload to the sites I use daily."
11109,"I've never had any major issues with my 4s. i swear it never let my down. ever since i got my iPhone 5s, its been nothing but a headache. theres nothing different between the phones besides the size and fingerprint scanner that i barely use. if you're looking for a new phone and don't want anything too, too fancy. the iPhone 4s is worth it. i miss my 4 s! "
11110,"I have had 6 different phones in the past 2 years. THey keep getting replaced because the screen breaks so easily. However, I love all the apps it has. It is like my life line maps and siri help me a ton."
11111,"I was in the market for a new phone and noticed that this phone was only a couple hundred bucks so I decided to give it a shot.  Before buying this phone,  I've only had androids and had tons of problems with bugs and apps crashing.  I was never a fan of apple products, mainly the iPhone, because I felt they were too expensive and overrated.  Now having the phone for about a year, I'm glad I bought this phone.  The only negative things I can say about this phone is that it tends to get hot quick and the phone's screen can shatter easily.  I'm never going back to androids and planning on upgrading to the 5s soon."
11112,"I thought it was a great deal because I signed a contract and paid $1.07 for the phone but, after having it for a week, I wish I could have traded it back in! With the new IOS, the phone slowed down DRAMATICALLY, the apps seem to be always crashing, the phone freezes and its incredibly delicate like any other apple product (one inch drop = spider web crack).  "
11113,I love my iPhone. I am truly team iPhone and i can't wait till the new one comes out. Apple always amazes me with the updates ever so often.
11114,"I've had my Apple iPhone for almost 2 years now. It was a great phone in the beginning, but performance slowly started going down hill. The only damage that has been done to it (I'm very clingy to my phones and always protective over them breaking) was I completely submerged it under water, and with the help of rice and a plastic bag, my phone began working again in two days. However, the performance of the 4G, was a bad experience for me. It sucked out 4G like crazy, and went over my limit and we had to pay extra money on that bill. I had to turn off all 4G. It's a been a good phone for the past two years, but I am considering a samsung galaxy."
11115,"I love my iPhone - so easy to use and (mostly) reliable. I can say though, the biggest downfall to iPhone (and probably smart phones in general) is as time progresses, the older phones become harder to use because of new technology. Speaking in just a matter of a couple short years here."
11116,"I originally bought this phone because I wanted to play Diamond Dash on it, not a good reason to buy a phone as I got quickly bored of it and switched to Android within 3 months
"
11117,"I love my 4s had it for almost a year nd no problems. i usually get a new phone every year because something happens to them but the 4s hasn't gave me any problems ""yet"". only issue i have with apple is that they don't cover water damage. my phone when into dock mode because moustier went into it but it was a easy fix. i hated when they updated to iso 7 because on iso 6 you were able to update facebook or twitter from your notification. cant do that anymore "
11118,"I love this phone don't get me wrong, but sometimes having more than 10 apps can over whelm the phone. My Iphone used to freeze a lot and crash. but after i erased some of the apps and did the updates it did it less often. "
11119,I prefer this iPhone over the iPhone 5s! If I was able to use mine with my new carrier I would prefer that! 
11120,I really enjoy this phone there's lots of things like apps picture quality and all that I really like there's also a great variety of phone cases and the battery usually last me all day and I'm on it often
11121,I have a i phone 4s but i think the apple company needs to work on making them shatter and water proof. other than that i think the phone is great quality. i recommend it over a galaxy. 
11122,"It's a great phone. I haven't cracked the screen yet, and I love that apple continues to allow it to update to the newest iOS. Reliable and fancy."
11123,I wanted an iPhone for years and was finally able to get one right after the 5 came out. I love almost everything about this phone! I have had it for over a year and have never had a case for it and there are no cracks! I drop it all the time so that is a miracle. It does tend to freeze and apps crash but it doesn't happen too often. 
11124,"I have had my iPhone 4S for a little more than two years and have little to no issues. I like that it backs up your contacts, emails and pictures every two days. It is pretty user friendly right out of the box. I downloaded the user manual and have had to refer to it infrequently.  I highly recommend the iPhone for people who are technology challenged...it takes one or two steps to accomplish simple things compared to Android based phones which take more steps to accomplish simple things and the instructions tend to over explain things which can be confusing. "
11125,Hey!!! I actually LOVE LOVE LOVE my iPhone 4s it works great an I'm always on it !!! It has tones on cases an they are pretty
11126, This is a really good phone . I haven't had any major problems with it. Its small and i love that i have Suri on my phone .
11127,"I've had mine for about 3 years now. It's a great phone. It's much sturdier than the previous model as I've been known to drop mine on occasion and it still hasn't cracked. It does fine running the newest OS and it generally gets the job done. The screen isn't as nice sure, and the battery life leaves something to be desired, but I have very few complaints about this phone. "
11128,"I absolutely love my iPhone - one of the best phone purchases I have ever made - I have no major issues with it. It's easy to use, takes great pictures and has great apps for it. I use my phone for a lot of my business work as well as fun stuff. It is always with me. "
11129,"Even now, 2014 and almost 2 whole different models later, mine works perfect, even AFTER my boyfriend dropped it in chocolate milk."
11130,"Still love the phone. Works really well, I love the apps and the system. I've never had a problem with the phone. Had it for about 2 years now. "
11131,I have had this phone for two years. Works fine but the Siri kind of sucks and sometimes it's slow and freezes up. Although I suspect that's because I drop it a lot!
11132,Ive had this phone for 2 years I have hundreds of cases and. Chargers never broken 
11133,"The quality is stunning. Anyone wanting to see a fun video, go on YouTube and watch the Android guys do a drop test against the S3."
11134,I love me all my apple products especially the iPhone 4s that i have. It is good and has majority of the features the iPhone 5 has.. All in all it is great
11135,"I now own the 5S, but this was a great phone! It worked like it should! I recommend it!"
11136,I've had my 4s for 3 yrs now. I have loved it. I'm looking to upgrade now to the 5s but I have loved this apple product.
11137,"Great phone, great features. Only problem I have with it is the battery life."
11138,I've had my iPhone for about four years now and it hasn't given me any problems at all. I am someone who uses their iPhone every minute and for it to still function exactly the same from when I first got it is incredible. I have been loyal to Apple since eight years ago and plan to keep it that way. To this day I have not been disappointed with their products. 
11139,"I have this phone for work, and I also have a personal Samsung Galaxy S4. Of the two I prefer the Galaxy. I often find myself frustrated because I feel like things aren't as intuitive as I think they should be. I like the messaging, and I like that there are a lot of apps that are available on the 4s, but I would never switch over to this phone from my Galaxy."
11140,"Not my favorite iPhone, the camera is limited and doesn't look very hd but it does the job and looks the part and looks nice in your hand"
11141,I have the iPhone 4 and it worked great the only bad thing was if you dropped it was shattered. Recommend that you are really careful with
11142,"Great phone, but gotta be careful with it! I have the 5s now, and the big thing for me is having a good case around it. "
11143,Muy buen celular lo unico es que siento que es muy pequeño y ademas de que me gustaria que le agregaran mejores funciones comoque siempre es lo mismo con los iphone y ademas de que este en especial no sale muy bien las fotos
11144,Great Phone. Just gotta have a good case for it because if you drop it it can easily brake.
11145,"Super sturdy phone, i had one when it first came out, dropped it on concrete daily and never shattered and no scratches. This phone would've lasted for forever had it not gotten stolen out of my pocket in the Paris metro. Love the size and operating system, solid tool for everything"
11146,"This phone seems to hold up pretty well, most of the people I know that purchased the 4s when it came out stills works fine for them. Yes it's slower then the 5, 5s or 5c."
11147,Its good but the 5c and 5s it always better .. the phone is wide yes but feel good in hands
11148,My sister has this phone and it seems decent but the camera stinks. I love taking pictures with my phone and because the Iphone camera is no bueno I would never buy this phone! 
11149,I really loved my iPhone 4! It did end up being slow after having it for years but it was so durable! I dropped it all the time (being clumsy) and it never broke! not even a small scratch! Love the iphone 4!
11150,Love my iPhone four! it has worked great for me and I am so excited for the new iPhone coming out. This one has worked great for me which is really good! 
11151,"Amazing phone, you could never go wrong with Apple. my wife has been with apple since day one. I love how everything is made for iphone before anything else, and the apps are just that more amazing on iOS. "
11152,"I love iPhones so needless to say, I love any apple product. They are absolutely amazing "
11153,"A great phone. Very user friendly - even my low-tech mother can use it. The phone has great tools and a very clear screen.
"
11154,Towards the end of my time with it the speakers no longer worked and the phone would often overheat to the point where I couldn't touch it anymore. At one point I actually thought it might explode. In saying that it served me well over the two years I had it. Definitely wouldn't have traded it for another phone.  
11155,"My 4s was nice when I first got it but after a couple months you start the notice the wear and tear and it's horrible, they're not very good phones and by the time I'd had mine 6 months half the stuff on it didn't work"
11156,"I've never had any apple products till june so this was a step up from my windows phone. i don't really like the front camera quality. facetiming and iMessage is really good with Wifi. It does like to restart by itself. On the good side is that there is a large variety of cases to choose from since it was a popular phone, but since the 5c ,5,and 5s they get all the new fashions and trends and not us"
11157,The first iphone I ever got was the 4s and at first I loved it. Until the screen cracked. Three times. It seemed like it would break for no reason. My iphone 5 is much more durable! 
11158,"When I had first gotten my mac book pro and my iphone 4s I thought that apple products were wonderful.  However, the sleek and sexy product I was fast to fall in love with was not durable in the least.  On my iphone 4s, which was always kept in a nice case (otter box), had problems after the first 4 months of having it.  The first thing I noticed is that when I took it out to clean it the phone lost its shine and held dirt very badly.  After 5 or 6 months I had problems with the touch screen not working.  It would either not respond at all or when I went to touch it it would bug out and do all  kings of crazy things.  What they do not tell you is the iphone is also highly incompatible with other devices and computers.  When you switch from any iphone to another phone you have to completely disable your imessenger.  I had a horrible time which included me on the phone with my phone provider for several days before they finally had to send me to a apple specialist who had to send me to a high manager who then eventually figured out that I had to completely delete my imessenger account in order to receive all my text messages from my friends who still had iphones when I did not.  "
11159,Ive had this phone for almost 4 years and its still in perfect condition ! hardly ever has any issues and almost impossible to break
11160,"I have had nothing but problems with this phone and I've only had it 1 year. It restarts itself when it wants, battery life is terrible even with minimal usage, the keyboard used to be way better, the IOS's get worse with each upgrade. Definitely switching to Android. "
11161,Love my iphone 4s! Ive had it for a while now and its still going! Great phone!
11162,Believe it or not I received this phone as a Christmas gift from my husband and it was the first apple product I ever owned. Once I got the hang of how it worked it is the best phone I ever had!
11163,"I love my iphone 4s. the apps are excellent and i love how fast the phone is. However, it has been 1.5 years since I got my phone and the battery is now crashing when it gets to 30% or crashes in the cold weather."
11164,"By far the best phone I've ever had; and I've had Android and Microsoft phones, as well as prepaid... This is the only phone that hasn't failed me. It runs very smoothly and never freezes. I've had it for over a year and everything works wonderfully - even after dropping it numerous times. "
11165,I love my phone. i use it for everything and it has served me well. i cant wit for the 6 to come out
11166,I love love love my phone. My only complaint is that it often resets or turns off and I have recently experienced the alarm skipping.
11167,I had this before I up graded to the 5c and I enjoyed it just as much as I do the five the have the same features and apps the screen is bigger
11168,"My battery literally dies after only looking at it once in a 3 hour period. Other than that, I like my phone but I wish it was faster and thinner."
11169,"I love my phone but it's been pretty awful after I got my screen fixed. I thought it would make it better, but it's just super slow, can't detect whether it's plugged in or not, which messes up my music flow."
11170,"I've had my iPhone for over a year. Siri has gotten a lot better and ios 7 is GREAT! A 16 GB iphone wont last very long. Now its kind of slow, but still useable. Luckily I have not broken it yet but it is very delicate and most of my friends have broken them multiple times. Not too many negatives, but not too many positives! Battery is the biggest problem, so is storage."
11171,"I love my iphone. but I would highly recommend if you do get an iphone investing in a good case you trust. my next iphone i will be getting a life proof case, not cheap but worth it. "
11172,"The main negative for the iphone is its price and that they don't tend to have as long as a lifetime as other apple products. It just seems like they get outdated so much faster than the computers but still cost a lot. That being said, you have access to a  lot of apps and if you have other apple products, the ability to sync between products is nice."
11173,"I loved my iphone 4s.  Among other awesome features, Siri is extremely helpuful! The 4s offered great programs like Facetime, and a high quality camera.  This was my all time favorite iPhone!"
11174,"Amazing phone! I'm an apple girl, can't wait for the iPhone 6!! Siri is a great feature, love this phone!"
11175,"Love my iphone 4S. The camera is good quality, I love the multi-task features and siri is helpful (sometimes). I love the look of it and how nicely it feels when I'm holding it, it feels comfortable.   Not bulky and not like I'm going to drop it."
11176,"I love the iPhone 4s it's not to big, a little heavy, but the picture quality is great. I would totally recommend this phone "
11177,"I had this phone and honestly, EVERYTHING ALWAYS BREAKS. The screen is so easily shattered, the home and lock buttons easily jam and are hard to press.  The camera quality isn't that great. It's an alright product. The later generations of iphones are much better."
11178,I love apple products just because they are so functional. The only bad thing about the 4s is that the phone is starting to slow down with all the new software that apple is releasing. 
11179,"So much better than the iPhone 5!! If you have the option, the 4s is a lot better!!!!  And you still have Siri"
11180,"I recently upgraded to the iPhone 5, but I must say I loved my iPhone 4, it had lasted me for a long time and is still going strong. My husband uses it now and has had no issues from it yet!!"
11181,"This phone is a great investment in your money. It does a great job calling, texting, and Siri does a great job with Q/A. I have dropped it so many times, and it has never broken. The size is very small so it is nearly undetectable. The touch screen takes on a lot of damage before getting smeared and gunked up. The phone does a great job, and you should buy it."
11182,I have this phone and i love it!! but hopefully i will have the iphone six in a couple of weeks!
11183,"Big fan of the phone! Though it's not as high tech as the 5s, it still works great and is worth the money!"
11184,I should of kept the 4. Battery life last longer them the 5. The 4 is easier to used.
11185,"I have the 4S still and have no need or want to upgrade to the 5. I don't see much of a difference. The phone works great, has great battery life, tons of memory, and the camera on it is great! Especially once you edit the photos to how you want."
11186,"Great phone and all, but hate the fact that it cracks so darn easily. It becomes a issue when you have to keep replacing the screen so much."
11187,Bot a bad phone but a bit glitchy at times. Still better than the competitors Galaxy or Nokia Lumia. The iOS is also better compared to android!
11188,"My 4s has been through so much and is still going strong. It's been thrown off a moving car, dropped dozens of times and has no chips or cracks. "
11189,"I have an iPhone 4S, yes I'm so behind on my phone but I'll finally be upgrading to the IPhone6. Just make sure not to drop it or else its gone"
11190,"Its a great phone its just becoming outdated extremely quick. If you don't want the one thats about to come out and don't have the money for a 5 this would make a great phone.  I recommend buy a barely used one or brand new off ebay. Because of their age they are begining to have some parts break, my wifi connector went out on my first one and my seconds display is dim already."
11191,I've had the iPhone 4s for over two years! Absolutely LOVE my iPhone and the app selection. Battery life kinda sucks but can't wait to upgrade when the iPhone 6 comes out!
11192,I loved the iphone 4s until I purchased the iphone 5s which I am in love with I am and will always be a apple lover :-)
11193,I had an i phone 4s.. I loved it.. But my daughter threw it on the floor and it shattered.. I cant afford a new one but hopefully i will soon
11194,"I like how easy the phone is to use- I've had it almost 2 years now. I also enjoy all the different apps that are available and being able to put all my music on it, but my phone also crashes a lot and the battery is quite awful. Not to mention how heavy the phone actually is. Not exactly my favorite phone that I've owned. "
11195,I have had my 4s for about 3.5 years. It has been great to me.  Every know and then it has its issues but other than that I love it.  I don't like all these phones that are becoming huge!
11196,"I loved my iphone 4 when I had it, tons of app choices and my phone never crashed on me or acted up! I just upgraded to a galaxy s4 so I gave it to my parents. After getting my galaxy I realized how small the iphone was! lol."
11197,My iphone four lasted through TWO trips into water it was pretty hardy although the third time it was not so lucky the one complaint I have is that when I upgraded to ios 7 the iphone 4 was not capable of running it properly it completely slowed down the phone. Since then I have upgraded to the iphone 5s
11198,"I liked my iPhone 4S when I received it as a birthday present. I upgraded to the iPhone 5 and gave my 4S to my boyfriend. Since then it has been about a year and his phone is super, super slow compared to the 5. It seems as if the new updates have made the older models sluggish and unresponsive at times. I will probably not purchase another iPhone because of their constant releases of new models. "
11199,"Good, reliable and easy to use. This is my first iPhone and I don't know if I can go back to any other kind of phone now. I love apple way too much!"
11200,"I love my iphone! so easy to use, and emojis are the best thing ever! I cant wait until i can get a new version cause its time for an upgrade."
11201,"Easy to use, pleasing minimalistic design, great applications.  Video and photo quality is so-so, as it looks great on your phone, but super blurry when you upload it onto a computer.  The buttons break/stop working for no apparen't reason; I know at least twenty people whose home buttons and/or power buttons have randomly stopped worked.  Also, the screen is very fragile.  "
11202,I usually go through phones before my plan is up. My iPhone has lasted me almost 3 years so far. Super easy to use has apps for just about anything you'll need. The only problem is I know a lot of people's power button sticks.
11203,I've had this phone for over 2 years and love it.  I've never had any trouble with it and the only reason I'm getting rid of it is for the iPhone 6 upgrade.  
11204,"I love my iPhone 4 it's like my best friend. Lol It holds my whole life in one place. Keeps me super organized, in the know, entertained and stress free all in one spot. "
11205,You only like iPhone until you experience something else. I guess they're ok for simplicity but other than that I don't like them.
11206,"I enjoyed my iPhone 4s while I still had it. It endured quite a bit and was used to run multiple applications for work. I had the 16gb which seemed to not be enough space for me to run all the apps, etc for work and my personal. This was my very first iPhone and apple product, and it was good enough to convert me to Apple forever!"
11207,"I enjoyed this phone while it functioned. Soon became TOO long slow, and drove me NUTS."
11208,I love my iphone 4s. I have had it for two years and not a thing has gone wrong with it!! I would highly recommend!! 
11209,What a trooper! ive smashed the back of my phone a few months ago and its still working! great weight...hope that apple goes back to this size
11210,I had to get mine replaced twice because the lock button kept getting stuck! Not happy! Not to mention how slow the phone got once it couldn't support the most recent updates
11211,"I was apprehensive about getting this phone. It was my first iPhone and my friends conceived me to get it as an upgrade. Yes it has a nice sleek design and a simple, easy to use interface but that's about all it has going for it. I immediately regretted my decision and continued to hate the phone for the two years I was forced go use it until I could upgrade again. It was just like a iTouch, except I could make phone calls with it. Why do I need an iTouch and an iPhone when they are basically the same thing? The iPhone does nothing for me to personalize it as my own. Emojis were the highlight of the iPhone 4s. Eventually my home button kept getting stuck and the phone would start freezing causing me to turn it off and on multiple times a day. Apple was not helpful in any way. "
11212,"I have a iphone 4 and i love it i don't see much diffrence in iphone5 and iphone4 besides the screen! thats all 
"
11213,"I love my phone, I have dropped it a million times and I have never checked it (knock in wood). I love that I don't have to constantly type in my pass code to unlock it.  It's great, I love that I can sync it to my ipad too! "
11214,"Super handy to have everything you need on your phone, but my phone is slow and I wish it had more GBs of storage"
11215,"Love iPhone but after I updated, the WiFi button got stuck and I could not get it replaced because the back glass was shattered so I was told in order to get it replaced, I needed to pay for the insurance and all."
11216,"Love my 4s. Works well with iOs 7, has withstood a ton of abuse, lots of power, no real faults. I love it, but am looking forward to a bigger screen in the future. It meets all of my needs now. "
11217,I love my iphone. I have been able to travel alone in the US and Europe by using its great map applications and call plan. I have dropped the phone a million times and it still works just fine! I can always hear people on the other line and receive all texts successfully!
11218,"This was my first iPhone! It lasted for so long. I have dropped it so much and had it for 3 years but one day I dropped it just right and it cracked! The phone still worked perfectly, I got my messages, and my calls. I just could not stand the crack any longer!"
11219,I used to LOVE this 4s. I still do but when I went to go get another one (my phone broke like always for everyone) they told me 4's would become not operational anymore :( Had to get a 5s (I love that too) though
11220,"The 4S was my very first iPhone. I got it almost two years ago after upgrading from an Android. It is SO much better for me than my Android phone was. Honestly I don't use Siri all that much... I tend to forget that it's an option I guess. But it is a fun feature to have. 
Now that I've had the phone for almost two years I am SO ready to upgrade though... I will be sticking with iPhone and probably going for the new iPhone 6. The 4S has seriously become a pain with the battery not lasting even until lunchtime somedays. Definitely something Apple could improve on. "
11221,"This was my first iPhone, and once I got the hang of all the difference I really enjoyed it! It works great and I can honestly say I will probably now be a loyal apple user. The only thing that I did have an issue with was that over time the lock button broke on this phone and it was a total pain in the butt. But, not enough for me to dislike the rest of this amazing phone! "
11222,"Good phone but iOS 7 seems to make it slower and use more battery life. I've had mine for 2.5 years and the battery is always low, especially on 4g. Many people i know have cracks on the screen, and i don't have mine in a case and there is only one hairline crack that is barely noticeable. Seems like the glass they use is not consistent, some phones are stronger than others. But overall a great phone and its lasted a long time considering how much i use it!"
11223,I absolutely love the iPhone id be lost with out mine I am clumsy and have to have it in a case but its great phone 
11224,"I just switched over to the galaxy 5 and I love this more than my iPhone 4, I liked all the features for the iPhone but galaxy is way better"
11225,"I've had my iPhone 4s since February and to be completely honest, I regret choosing the iPhone over the Samsung Galaxy (and I've played around with the Galaxy S5 and was highly impressed by it). There are a few pros to the iPhone 4s, but the cons by far outweigh the pros. My phone freezes up way more than it should. It tells me at least once a week that I can't do something because there is too much space taken up yet I have deleted so many things, it's not even funny. However, if there is anything I will take up for the iPhone, it's the battery life. Everyone I've talked to and almost all of the negative reviews I've read say that the iPhone has the worst battery life and I disagree. For a smart phone, I'm pretty impressed with it's battery life. I could go on and on discussing all of the pros and cons, but there's a few for y'all to keep in mind. I can see how some people may be able to look over the flaws of the iPhone so I can't sit here and tell you to completely steer clear, but personally, I'm very excited for my upgrade to come around so I can go to the Galaxy."
11226,Love this product!! Apple is great!! Can't wait until the iphone 6 comes out!!!
11227,"Love my iPhone and Apple in general. Such a great company that produces reliable products. I had issues with my iPhone at one point so I took it into the Genius Bar, that ended up giving me a new phone on the spot. Great customer service, I am an Apple user for life. I cannot wait to get my hands on the iPhone 6."
11228,"I've had this phone for over 4 years and it's never had an issue. It's beautiful, sleek, smart, efficient, and useful. I love this phone."
11229,"My current phone - sadly I've had hardware issues from day 1!  when it was new and beautiful and unharmed, the screen was amazing and the speed was great.  Now, after 3 years, the battery doesn't last very long but it still does the job! "
11230,"Its okay I really made a mistake for switching from android to IPhone it isn't as great as very one makes it sound all though it has very cute case for it
"
11231,I have had my iphone for years now and I love it. The only thing they need to work on is making it harder to bust the screen. Ugh its horrible when the screen is busted. 
11232,"My first ever iPhone! I use an iPhone 5s now, so it is more advanced! But my 4s was wonderful! Such a reliable, easy to use phone!"
11233,This phone was really hod but after a year it starts to slow down witch it sucks. Apple needs to change it up a little all iphones are basically the same thing.
11234,"This is a great phone. I left blackberry and got this as my first phone. I haven't broken it, no scratches nothing. I take care of it and it's never given me a problem"
11235,"I do not like my iPhone 4 for many reasons, I do not receive some messages nor will they send . Also I can't take a lot of picture, my phone calls never go through & my phone is always freezing & stops working . "
11236,Had my 4s for 3 years! Just recently updated. Never had a problem out of it! Honestly it was probably the best phone I had! 
11237,"I love this phone and will never not have an iphone! I love the ease of use, the camera quality is awesome! "
11238,Love my phone to death! The only problem I find with my 16gb is that I'm always out of storage and being forced to delete pictures and videos that I wanted to save. It's never given me too much of a problem though. Iphones are the best!
11239,"I love my phone. This is probably the best phone I have had yet. The only this is that I wish I had more storage, but other than that all I can say is that Iphones are the best"
11240,"I bought my 4s 2 years ago (3-yr contract) and it is still going strong, never had an issue.
Last winter, my phone fell out of my pocket onto the asphalt and I never realized it was gone until late at night. I retraced my steps but couldn't find it, so I gave up. The next morning I went to my friend's house and my phone was lying on the ground (this is AFTER the garbage truck went by, thank god no one took it) and there wasn't a scratch on it. My phone didn't turn on right away due to the freezing internal temperature, so I wrapped it up in a towel and left it for a couple hours. That night it worked like normal, not a thing wrong with it :) 
THANK YOU APPLE!!
I do wish it had more storage because I am beginning to run out of space (16GB, I recommend the 32GB) because I don't have much music or pictures on there to begin with.  But eh, can't have it all ;)"
11241,I love the I 4s it has the internet so I don't have to take out my laptop! I can also go any way and still have my Internet. And I love to play games 
11242,I have to say this is a great phone if you keep it in good condition! I have had it since the first day it came out! Still going strong!
11243,"My fiance has this phone.  When comparing it to my iPhone 5, the iPhone 4S is really bulky but overall its a good phone and its fast."
11244,"Love doesn't even begin to cover what I feel about this phone. It was my first iPhone and it made me fall in love. Never thought I could love a phone so much. I had a blackberry before this one. My blackberry was awesome but this phone made my life so much easier. Before I literally carried around my phone, camera and iPod. When I upgraded, this condensed everything into one! I now have the 5s. The few draw backs I found with this phone were that it was a bit bulky(compared to the 5s), the battery life(on mine at least) wasn't  very good and the glass back AND front. Other than that, AMAZING!"
11245,I bought this phone and switched from an htc but i didn't really like it. The thing i did like was how clear it looked when watching videos. 
11246,"It's definitely a trusty phone and I've always enjoyed apple products. But seeing some of the other smartphones that are coming out with better screens, cameras, and functions makes me a little bit sad. This phone by itself with no comparison is a great phone though! It's durable too with the right cover!"
11247,Okay I am an apple fanatic! I don't have tht phone anymore because I upgraded to a 5s but I loved it! Apple products rock. It was nice and heavy and I've only had to replace it once when I dropped it on a laundry mat floor without the case on it. Also I loved it's speed
11248,Currently have an iphone but i love the 4s. it works really and great introduction to iphones.
11249,"The 4s has been my favorite i phone so far, when i switched to the 5, and then the 5s, i still loved the 4s more. We will see when the 6 comes out!"
11250,I used to have an iPhone 4s. I loved this phone! It worked great an never broke on me. Only reason I got rid of it was to upgrade to 5s. Great phone like all Apple products!
11251,"I was so against going to an iPhone 3 years ago.  I wanted to stick with Android based phones but at the time every one myself and my husband had started acting up before the 6 month mark.  After at least three different types I decided it was time to move on to an iPhone.  I have not once regretted the decision!  I still have the 4s and it's running strong.  I am not even sure I will upgrade to the 6 only because this one has been working amazingly for me...well, and the cost of an upgrade is holding me back.  Great phone!"
11252,I'm currently using this phone.. its really handy.. after using iphone can't use any other phones.. just doesn't match up to it.. looking forward to buy iphone 6 soon :)
11253,"I killed my iPhone 4s I loved that phone. It replaced my android and I treated it like a child. I currently have a 5s so I will try not to compare the 2 phones. I love Siri-she's great when you need to do something vocally. The only downfall is when she goes off in your bag during a test or goes off in your pocket. Still mad that Siri never told me a story though. The camera was good. It lasted many many many falls (including sliding across a sidewalk and almost being stepped on) but sadly died because of falling in a water filled sink. That's my only complaint about iPhones. Now that there are waterproof Androids, I want to see a waterproof iPhone. Definitely a great phone overall. Worth getting if you want to want for the iPhone 6 bugs to be worked out"
11254,"I was very worried about buying an Apple product because I am a die hard PC fan but this was a great phone for me for many years, rarely did I ever run into any issues...but the new iphones bending is going to be a big concern for me wanting to consider a phone from them again."
11255,"The iPhone 4s is a little out dated now.  It has Siri, which helps out a lot when wounding how to spell words and find places.  It's not as fast as the newer iphone 5's but can still do the job."
11256,Had my 4S for about two years and it held up just fine.  Only gripe would be that the glass screens just aren't as scratch-resistant as they used to be.  I actually prefer the size of the 4S to the newer versions of the iPhone.
11257,I loved my iphone 4 when i had it.  Only thing that i did not like was how fragile it was and it has to be hooked up to itunes for simple stuff such a ringtones
11258,"I loved the iPhone 4 when it was still decently new, but now I think Apple is trying to phase out all the iPhone 4's. Ever since they've updated the iOS, my phone's been draining the battery really badly and it's running slow."
11259,It's just another iPhone that people loved and now forget about because the iPhone 6 is out. This is as good a phone as any other. Don't waste your money on the newest one; this phone is just as good
11260,Had this phone for a little over 2 years before upgrading to the 5s and never had any issues love apple products!
11261,I dislike iPhone I need my music I don't have the money to buy music I want most apps you have to pay for Samsung all the way!
11262,I had a 4s before I got a 5s and I really liked it. Now that I have the 5s it's hard to think back because the 4s did seem smaller and a little chunkier but it did run smoothly and worked great during the time I had it
11263,"I like this phone a lot. I like the small size, as opposed to the newer iPhone sizes. It runs pretty well most of the time, and I like the case options for the phone. I'm not a fan of the recent iOS update, but otherwise the phone is great."
11264,I absolutely love the 4s. I think the size is perfect and is very compatible with all of my other Apple products. It makes organizing everything a cinch!
11265,I give this product an A from its time period. It's smfor sure time to upgrade to a newer device. If you have never owned an iPhone and are just looking for a cheaper phone the 4s is the lowest model I would choose. Shoot for an iPhone 5 if possible. 
11266,"I've love my 4s for years now, but the battery life is not very good. There are definitely better options available now, but mine has been reliable. "
11267,Great phone. I still love mine. Tho some of the bugs are annoying. I've had no problems with it
11268,Recently just switched over to team iPhone from an android and it is a huge difference. I can access everything so much faster everything works so much better and is so much more easier to use
11269,"The iPhone 4s is a great phone, I've had mine for a year and a half now. I feel like it's better than the new generations, I wouldn't trade my 4s in for anything "
11270,"I've had my ophone for over two years now and it's still great! The only unfortunate part is that with the updates  its starting to lag a bit, but I'm going to keep this one until I can't anymore!"
11271,This was my first iphone and I loved it. I had it for just about 2 years and it was still working great when I went to upgrade. It was a little slower but that is normal for iphones. 
11272,This phone works great! We still have ours and they are a little slow but we've had them forever haha
11273,"Reviewing in 2014 doesn't even begin to shine light on to how it ran in 2011. This phone was great for its time. It still would work for now but there are better alternatives. It will be slower, but the phone would still run well."
11274,This was my first smart phone and I LOVED it. It was fantastic - until that iphone 5 came out. 
11275,"I loved my iPhone 4. I never really liked the iPhone until this one came out, and I still think it's a great phone. Not as advanced and high-tech as the new versions, however. "
11276,"I used this phone for a few years, I think. It served me well, until my battery life started to decline, then I upgraded to the 5s."
11277,I love my 4s. i would prefer it over any of the newer versions. this is just the right size for me and it is just the same as the others. looks exactly like my boyfriends 5s
11278,I love my iPhone! The iOS 7 update made it so much better. The battery life is not the best.... I had to purchase a new battery after having it for a little over a year. But other than that the phone is wonderful!
11279,I love my 4s. I am actually having trouble parting ways with it. I had upgraded during Xmas to the galaxy s4 and within two weeks i was right back to my 4s. 
11280,"I loved my 4s, I upgraded to the 5c about a year ago and already had it replaced within the first 6 months due to a screen glitch. The 4s was a lot more stable! "
11281,It feel the 4s it's a great phone. It does everything it should. After two years the front and back screen cracked. Luckily I ordered the screens and fixed it myself. Quick and easy and much cheaper than buying a new phone
11282,The 4s is a great phone. The battery life is amazing.  The downfall is the back of the phone is made of glass and has a issue with the power button sometimes
11283,"Even though this phone is 4 years old, which is ancient in iPhone standings, I still love it. This phone is small, but just the right size. Yes, with iOS 8 it runs a bit slower, but I still love my phone just as much as when I first got it and it wasn't as outdated. I plan on keeping this phone for a couple more years, or until I simply cannot use it anymore. Love it!"
11284,"Apple always has had the ability to make a very easy, simple and user friendly phone. This was my first smart phone, and I'd suggest this to all beginner's and older people. This phone isant very durable so do yourself a favor a get a good case. There is no expandable memory. Good for those who also have many other Apple products. I now have the Samsung Galaxy S5 and I'm extremely happy with it. "
11285,This was my first iPhone and the one I currently use. I love it. I know it inside and out and I don't think I would trade it for any other phone. I would recommend getting a good case for it though because it is fragile.
11286,I love my iPhone and I love that it isn't too big or too small I enjoy mine and I don't feel the need to upgrade !:)
11287,This is my phone and with the current updates its running slow and my apps don't work as well. I loved it when it was new but now its time to get a new one. 
11288,"I love my iPhone, I have had a few of them now. I have had a 4 and a 4s. I recently did the updates to my 4s, (only because it was super glitchy as soon as the update became available.) I had to delete almost all of my apps, since I currently do not sync my phone to the computer only to the cloud. Then downloaded it, but now its super slow, and still glitches out. I use my phone constantly. I literally have to charge my phone almost always and that is the biggest issue. The battery life kills me but I have a handy dandy side battery pack that I carry with me and it charges the phone pretty quickly which helps me since I'm almost always on the go. Even though there are things that annoy me greatly about it I would never ever trade it for any other type of phone unless it was a newer iPhone. "
11289,I bought this phone for my daughter a year ago. It is her first smart phone bit she really enjoys it! 
11290,"Our 4s was my husband's first smartphone. Now, it's another device we can use on wifi. Great for kids, though doesn't hold up well when thrown so make sure it has a case. My kids just like that they have it full of their apps and we don't have to take it away when they get into our apps on our phones. I'm impressed that it's stood up to the amount of use my husband got out of it, and then my children. And still going strong! The ability to update software, even though it's no longer the newest on the market, makes it remain relevant. Good phone, good play thing, good all around."
11291,"Legit, the most sensitive phone I've ever used. dropped it once and the screen LED shattered in the back. NOT WORTH THE PRICE."
11292,This was my first iphone. but i cant really say i loved it because it was kinda iffy. ehhh it was okay.
11293,This was my first iphone and I was happy with it. It was the most recent iphone when I got it so it worked great and was wonderful. It's a bit behind now in terms of editions so I don't know if it's still the best
11294,"I love this phone. It's been working strong for over two years now. However, it started being a little slower since the newest update. I'm hoping it will last a while longer!"
11295,"This was my first iphone and it has been nothing but a pain in the butt.  I just ordered the iphone 6, hopefully it is better than the 4s.  The 4s was very slow and always exiting out of apps while I was still in them."
11296,"I currently use this phone. I like it , I especially like using the iMessages. I'd like to be able to upgrade so it was a bit bigger , but under the plan I'm on this is the best ."
11297,"I enjoyed the iphone 4s very much when it was new, but the battery is EXTREMELY unreliable. I have this phone for close to 2 years and it will not hold a charge for more than a few hours if the wifi is on. I like the features and the accessability, but the camera is becoming more and more blurry with age. "
11298,I love my phone. It has taken so many falls and it's still alive. The top button broke but I can still do everything the same. 
11299,My boyfriend has had this phone since it came out and it is still intact. I wouldn't recommend downloading iOS 8 onto it. It makes it slower than a one legged man trying to kick down a screen door.
11300,"This phone was very trustworthy and always in my back pocket. The downside is, that over time it became very slow. Opening safari or another app became a chore. And all my data was lost about three times. "
11301,Love my iPhone 4s! It's perfect size and it holds it battery life for quite a while!
11302,I had an iPhone 4 and it worked unit they updated the iOS system. Now this phone doesn't work at all! Disappointing. 
11303,I had the iPhone 4s for quite a long time 4 years exact! It never failed me until the last few months I owned it when there was a glitch that Apple knew about but unfortunately didn't offer anything to help. I could not get wifi the last few months as the one button was not swipe able it was stuck in the off position
11304,I've had my phone for 2 + years it's a decent phone my camera flickers now but otherwise it's held up good. 
11305,Love my Iphone 4s! Does everything I need it to do and also has held up through my 3 year old playing games on it!
11306,"I love my iPhone 4 and Ive never had any problems, except that I wish the screen was a bit bigger but my upgraded iPhone 6 will be here in the mail Tuesday! Rip iPhone 4 and ur cracked screen AND back screen "
11307,"Hate. As soon as I got it, I started using data like crazy. I am not a tech idiot, so I knew to turn off all the unnecessary data usage, deleted all apps except a handful, and set those to use in wifi zones only. I have finally had to resort to turning off cell data at all times. My provider was not useful at all - said there is nothing wrong with the phone, that it's just the way I use it. Not true - I have an older generation iPhone for work, with far more active apps (including all of the apps I use on the iPhone4), quite a bit of data transfer, and data turned on all the time.  I use more data on the iPhone 4 in two days than I do on the older model in an entire month. Ridiculous. Apple agrees though, and I have an appointment for the geniuses to check it out...thanks Apple....but I still don't like you're phone. Siri is an idiot, also, but that's a gimmicky extra that I can live without anyway, lol."
11308,I used to have this phone and loved it I have the iPhone five now but I always loved my 4s although with the software out now I would go with the five
11309,This was a great phone. Suffered through many falls and never broke. Though the battery sucks on it now and it is hard to change the batter with a new one.
11310,"Great product. A bit on the older side of the refresh cycle, but still works. Stay on iOS7 for optimal performance. Still the best sized smartphone on the market."
11311,"This is one of the really good smart phones, even though it's now pretty outdated. The battery life and the camera is great, and it's a real tough and reliable phone."
11312,I am on my phone almost all day! I absolutely love this phone. However it is pretty old and i should probably get a more updated version
11313,I have this phone and I know we are all the way in the 6 one but I can pretty much say they are all the same so why change it.I really love my phone the only thing that changes is the IOS and the size of the phone some details but I really like my phone it works good and has a lot of memory.
11314,"I had this phone before I got my 6, and thought it was good. It was small, always fast and reliable, and good camera. Only issues was battery dies quickly, but that's because I use it so much."
11315,My husband has this phone and it works pretty well. He has not had any complaints on it and he has had it with out any problems for almost 2 years now
11316,I love my iPhone but the low battery life is pissing me off. Really want to update to the iPhone 6 Plus
11317,The 4S was my a great upgrade! I loved this phone!  If you have a 4 or below you definitely want to upgrade to the 4S.
11318,"Considering this was the first iPhone my husband and I got, we were sold immediately! It took a little bit to get used to after being with Blackberry, but it is so user friendly and at times, addicting!"
11319,"I have the iphone 4s. I can not live without it. I do everything on this phone. Social networking, watch TV,  pay bills,  ordering and use it as my alarm clock. The kids love playing on it as well. I have had no problems worn it in the two years I have owned it. Love it. "
11320,Miss my iPhone 4s. I made the mistake of switching to an android. The iPhone 4s is perfect size and is an overall excellent phone to have. 
11321,I have loved this phone.  Skipped the upgrade to 5 and now have the 6 coming in the mail.  I love Apple products just wish they came with external memory.
11322,"IPhone 4S it's a good phone, it's my first iPhone and I got admit it's very easy to function but the thing I don't like about this phone is that you cannot have that many apps on it. Sometimes if I have too much on my phone I can't take pictures or activate certain things. Sometimes my phone runs a little slow. "
11323,"I had this cell for 2 years and it never disappointed me. I dropped it a thousand times & never broke, very durable... it was so surprising. "
11324,I had my iPhone4 for three years. I loved it. I am an apple lady. I just recently just got the new iPhone 6. And I love it too
11325,"I like the 4s, but, like all things, there's room for improvement. I wish I could combine Droids and I phones (qualities from each)."
11326,"If its an iphone , you know it has to be good . Although it might be pricey but its def worth it"
11327,I've had my phone for about two years now and the only problems are the occasional app crash.  Very happy with the user interface and love how it connects to my iPad and Mac.
11328,"Apple iPhone 4S isn't a bad phone. I recently tossed it to purchase the 5C, really for the color, but my iPhone 4S worked just fine. I'd have some glitches here and there, but nothing too serious."
11329,"I absolutely love my Iphone 4s. Even with the 5 and 6 out already, I am just not ready to move on."
11330,"To me its still the best IPhone out of all. Its handy and not as big as the lastest ones, it fits easily into my pocket and for me the size of the screen is totally big enough."
11331,"It was a good phone while it worked. I don't really have any complaints, except the new iphones are definitely much better. "
11332,I've never had a problem with my IPhone 4s. It's awesome I love it. No flaws at all.
11333,"Great phone for my first Iphone!  I love that it can hold as many pictures as it does.  Battery life seems to be ok, however, if you are on it much the battery doesn't stay around."
11334,My first iPhone and I loved it great to be able to do so much with one device 
11335,"I have had my 4S for almost two years now and I really like it. It is a lot more simple than androids, and I always had issues with my android and I have never had a software issue with this phone. I really like the Iphones."
11336,"I bought the iPhone 4S mainly for Siri. I know that is sad, but it's true. When the upgrade for the 5 came out, my iPhone glitched and Apple didn't react as though they were willing to help me sort out my issues. I went back to Android, and do not miss the iPhone at all. But I will say, until the update, I loved the iPhone."
11337,I seriously love my Iphone 4S. This puppy has lived a great life since they came out about 3 years ago. I haven't found the need to upgrade the phone to the newest Iphones because it still performs so well. 
11338,"I have a 4s and I really like it. The battery life is pretty good and it takes good pictures, so I like that! Very easy to use."
11339,"I have 3 family members in my household using the 4s and they never complain about it so that already proves they are enjoying it. When you hold it in your hand it feels sturdy and high in quality. It's not the kind where it feels like it can break anytime soon. I used to use iphone but ever since I switched to an android I realized how much have iphone restricted its users. if you need a phone to just do phone calls, messages, and maybe take some photos then go for iphone but if you will be using much more then you might not like it as much. I still recommend it because I think they are high in quality. "
11340,"Well, my battery dies at 40% what else can I say. Also when I charge and the phone is on it's not charging but using up the battery. So the battery is shit! And it has to be on charger non-stop if you want to use all those amazing things it has to offer.
I don't thing I will be returning to Apple. "
11341,"The iPhone 4S is my most previous phone that I have had and I really enjoyed it. I had it for the past three years and I dropped it multiple times and it never broke. The battery started going out near the end, but otherwise, it was a faithful little guy."
11342,"Had one of these before my iphone 5s.... Great phones, loved when they added Siri."
11343,"This is the phone that I currently use- I haven't upgraded to the 6 yet, but I love this phone. Works great, fast, takes good pictures."
11344,"Incredibly durable.  I had this phone for 4 years, and didn't have a problem with it.  Works great and fast.  Camera could be better though.  "
11345,"My current phone :) As much as I'd love the latest model, finances have limited me to keep my 4s for a little bit longer, but it works for me :)"
11346,"I've always had a Samsung or Windows phone until recently. I decided to try the iPhone and this was the first model I experimented with. I absolutely love this phone, and although there are a lot of features I haven't even bothered learning about, it definitely is a great phone!"
11347,"I love my iPhone. It's the first smart phone I've ever had. There's only a few things I don't like about it. It likes to randomly shut off and turn back on. I don't like that many apps crash and have to be reopened. I love the quality of the camera. The photo editing apps available for no cost are pretty awesome. I use my iPhone to set alarms, reminders, as a day planner. It makes my life so much easier."
11348,I still have a 4s even though the 6 has come out. Aside from the space issues (I have a lot of pictures!!) its still holding up great 2 years strong!
11349,I have a 4 and it is a bit slower than the newer ones I find them way harder to break or crack and they seem to have more storage.
11350,"This was the first iPhone I got back in 2011 and it was great until the new updates came around, it just couldn't keep up with IOS 7"
11351,"Had this phone for 2 years and was completely surprised that it lasted as long as it did. By the end of my run with the phone, the new Apple updates made the phone even slower"
11352,"I really like my phone when I got it. Everything was great...camera,battery life,etc. as I have had it and used it, the battery doesn't even last a whole day and I'm on maybe 1-1.5 hours average, the camera had dereriated, and it is becoming slower. I am torn between Samsung or iPhone when my update is up."
11353,"Slow software. Go for the 5 or 5s if possible. More durable than the newer iPhones, but the 3G service just isn't up to par with the 4g. "
11354,"I love my iPhone 4s, i have had it for 2 years, and its the best phone i have had, I have dropped it so many times, or shall i say my 22 month old has dropped it so many times. And also she had drooled all over it and it still works great."
11355,I loved my iPhone 4S!! I had it for a while until someone lost it :( so.. I got the 5S. Love Apple ;)
11356,"I loved my phone, until I saw the samsung 4. I have since switch. Apples screen is to small, they restrict a lot for the user. "
11357,Still have the 4s and still working great with no update to iOS8. Battery is great and picture quality is still good. 
11358,"At the time, the 4c was everything.  Had Siri, more function.... So exciting.  Now?  It feels bully and useless."
11359,"I have a serious love-hate relationship with my phone. There are days where my phone is the greats phone I've ever had, then the next day I continplate about throwing it at the wall. It seems with every new update there is something I love about it, and something I can't stand. All I know is this girl is going back to an android after my contract is up."
11360,"I surely don't recommend this phone to anyone else. I can't wait to review a Samsung, because I'm tired of the iPhone. This was my first one & I thought it was cool until I realized how completely fragile this phone is due to the fact that it's basically all glass. So not good for any parent. If you get one I'd recommend never letting it free from a case."
11361,"It's a good phone, but the camera on it looks like crap now compared to the newer iphones, now I don't even want to take pictures with my phone now that I've seen the other phones pictures :/"
11362,I had an IPhone 4s for little over a year and have to say it's not a bad phone. Videos play good but hard to watch due to a small screen. Iphones are great for the minimalist in the world with not a lot of options for customization (which is not necessarily a bad thing). Would recommend for someone looking for an easy smart phone that's user friendly.  
11363,"Good phone, but obviously a lot has changed with the newer phones. The screen is a tad small and the camera is not very good. It works great and never gave me any issues with apps or any of the features it offered."
11364,"This was my first Iphone that I owned and I loved it. Very durable, even after dropping it many times. I love the glass screen makes it more clear."
11365,"I have had an Iphone 4s for almost 2.5 years and I am extremely disappointed with it. It's all the same designs as the older and newer iPhones and I have bad luck with my battery. This is the third 4s I've had since I've had an iphone and all of them the batteries die once they hit 50%. It keeps getting worse and worse. It's slowing down and freezing too.
"
11366,This phone made it through some rough times! It still worked great! Near the end it had a majorly cracked screen from being dropped so much..but it still functioned properly.
11367,"I had this phone for almost 3 years, it was a really good phone when I had it. The only issued I had as it aged were a button malfunction, and software slowing down when it was due for an upgrade. "
11368,"I like all the features on this phone for the most part.  It does everything you'd expect from an Apple product.  I only gave it 3 stars because I've had problems twice when doing software upgrades where I had to return to factory settings and lost all of my information, and the camera on this phone is terrible!  The pics come out very grainy."
11369,"I really loved this phone the size was great, and In the smart phone generation I've only had iPhones and have enjoyed everyone but so far the iPhone 5s is the latest one I've had and I love its size over the 4"
11370,"This phone is like my third arm or hand. It is part of me. I can't go anywhere without it. At this point of my life, we have a complicated relationship. haha It has been thorough a lot. I even washed the first iPhone 4s I've had with my dorm laundry once. Fun times and memories but it's almost time to let it go. "
11371,Definitely one of my favorite phones of all time. I had the 4s for about 2 years with sprint service. My favorite feature was the face timing without wifi! Kinda miss facetiming. 
11372,I loved the phone but I still prefer android cuz it lets u share pics and print them in the store
11373,This phone is ok but it breaks very easy and the speakers go out of it after so long and so does the screen
11374,Nice size but glass breaks far too easily and I've had problems with every one I've owned. Slow response time and apps and functions crash or have errors all the time.
11375,We use these at our office as work phones. They seem to like them as far as what they are capable of.
11376,"I really like my iPhone, never had one before, but I'm fully satisfied with it. "
11377,I was a big fan of my IPhone 4s. I now have the 5s as an upgrade. The phone lasted me three years and is still in great condition. Apple has great products!
11378,"This phone is easy to use. It lasts all day in battery charge.  Its somewhat small, but who built.  I recommend. "
11379,"This is such a god phone i really need on for christmas , it is soo easy to use all my friends have on and my sister has one "
11380,"I used my iPhone 4s for a little over two years.  It was my first iPhone so of course I loved it. It is a fine smart phone, very simple and easy to use.  However it did have it's down sides, about a year and a half of use in, the home button started breaking (i.e. not being responsive) to the point where i had to use the onscreen home button. The other issue with it was the battery life after one of the iOS updates.  Even though the rumors were at the time that this issue should be fixed in the next update, it never seemed to get resolved."
11381,This phone was great when it was the newest model! I had one for 2 years. Only drawbacks are its weight and the fact the back was glass. Made it easier to break. 
11382,"When I first got this phone 2yrs ago I was in love with it!! The day I got it someone txt me, & it vibrated off my car & hit the concrete shattering the back glass. It didn't affect the phone at all, just the looks. Recently after one of the many updates you are required to have the phone decided to turn itself off, change the ringtones, and many times just not work at all. NOT at all happy with my iPhone right now!!"
11383,"I really love my 4S and always have, but it is starting to glitch because of age (I assume). It started acting up literally a few days  after out two year contract ended. I still love it though."
11384,"My 4s withstood quite a bit. I ultimately traded it in for an android, but it was a great little phone for the two years I had it. "
11385,"I still have this old version of the iPhone and it still works. The only problem, for me, with iPhones is there is no way to add storage to the phone. I love to take photos and I love to listen to music so my memory got used up pretty quick. Other than that, I love this phone."
11386,As much as I love my iPhone. It's now 3 years old and not performing as well as it once did.  Battery doesn't last and apps crash and the phone freezes often and is slow :( I guess it's time to upgrade but I can decide if I should stay with and iPhone of not.
11387,"I used to love this phone until I started using the 5s. It is good until you update the software. It slows down the phone, so if you were to pay above 400$ on this phone, I would suggest to wait. Wait and invest a little more, or just do not update the software. "
11388,"4s is a great phone, only minor differences in the 5. Had it for a year before I upgraded and never had any problems with it."
11389,This was my old iPhone and it is just amazing! It is a perfect size for anyone and everyone.
11390,Phone started off great but only a few months after owning it the battery would not hold charge. 
11391,HUGE Apple fan love all iPhones all Apple prdicts the iPhone 4s is a great phone I had it before I upgraded to my 5s  would pick a apple phone over a android any day!!
11392,I just got rid of my 4s and i am so sad. this phone is the perfect fit in your pocket size. i know all phones are getting larger and people things that cool. but upgrading was the worst. i miss my baby 4s 
11393,"Great size and still works for me, very handy for everyday needs. Great product to start out with, no complaint."
11394,"I loved this phone a lot, didn't even want to upgrade it. But I promised to give it to my dad so I had to say goodbye after 2 years of having it. I thing I phones are very very reliable. I had other phones and they wasn't as reliable as this phone. I have dropped my phone so many times and still there were no scratches or anything else went wrong with it. After 2 years it looks and works like new. Only maybe the battery doesn't hold the charge as much as it did when new but still I think it's great. Picture quality is great as well. Big improvement from iPhone 4"
11395,I am super hard on phoned and usually have to replace them after 4 months. This lasted a year before my son put it in the toilet. Easy to use and I miss it.
11396,Good phone but quickly becoming out-dated and can't hand the current operating system being used by Apple.
11397,"I have to say, obviously having this phone for over 2 years, it holds up pretty good. Unfortunately, you can tell it's becoming way outdated. It was a great phone to get you started with iPhone, but now it's getting to be a pain with all the little issues, with not being able to update. "
11398,I love my IPhone 4 and after having it for two years now i am excited to get a new iphone to use all the new features that come along with them.
11399,This phone has lasted me the full two year contract! There are some flaws the longer you have it but I only have a month left to go!
11400,I love my Iphone 4s. Apple is always on point with their products. I can't wait to try out a newer vision of the Iphone.
11401,The best phone I have owned by far.  I am so happy with this phone and look forward to upgrading to the Iphone 6.
11402,"I'm still using the iPhone 4S and am very happy with it! Of course, I'd love to upgrade to the newest model but I'll wait until this phone dies, I'm afraid that might not happen soon enough :)"
11403,Great phone but the battery life is a major flaw. Easy to use and the camera takes decent photos. I cracked the screen on two but the third phone is still intact.
11404,"I used to have it before i had the iphone 5 & iphone 5s. At the time, when it came out it was awesome!! but now, no bueno. lol "
11405,I loved my iPhone 4S. I'm just glad the camera has been upgraded. I use my phone for all my pictures and I am constantly using it when I run as a GPS. 
11406,"My 4s was great in its day, but now the battery life is short and unpredictable and i am running really low on storage space, even though i don't have many apps. time for an upgrade i think"
11407,"I have never thought I would use an iphone but when my android phone had an accident, my daughter gave me hers in return for an new phone.  I have been using it for 3 months and I absolutely love it.  My model only has 8GB so I would have preferred the 16 GB model but it has been easy to use and I have had no issues with it.  I only wish it had a better camera.  All in all a great little phone!"
11408,"I love the white iphone 4s. It is small and a little thicker than more recent iphones, however, you can do the exact same things on it."
11409,OMG where do I start . the best phone ever I still use mine . well until I upgrade that is ... for much you can do with  it . I have it set up to unlock and start my car :)
11410,"Great phone. I love the one I have, it's just a little bit thicker than the newer versions"
11411,"Great phone, not that much different from the i phone 5! Has so many features!"
11412,I love siri. never had any problems with this iPhone besides the occasionally freezing
11413,"My first iPhone! :) I had it for 3-4 years and it did a phenomenal job keeping me organize and connected with the world. When I used up all of memories, that was when it start to lag and what not. Still, it worked fine. "
11414,"I used to have this phone before I got an upgrade. Compared to all the new Apple phones that are available now (5/5s, 5c, 6/6+ etc.) the iPhone 4S seems very slow and small. I know many people may prefer a smaller phone like this because it may be more convenient to them. However, for some reason, as soon as I got my new upgrade, the phone just seemed so much slower and was a pain to use. Perhaps it's because I now have something better to compare it to but I definitely prefer the iPhone 5/5s to this. "
11415,I had this phone when it just came out and back then it was the best of the best i think this phone was to advance for its time because to this day it still has the power to get everything done and the screen on this phone is pretty good yeah its kind of small now compare to the newer one but i guess that's why i have a ipad so if your not going to but a ipad buy the newer iphone but if you already have a tablet or laptop this phone is good don't waste money on another this one will make you happy and the price is nice and low now for these.
11416,I love my iPhone I  want the newer version of course. There is two things that i hate about my iPhone one is that its made from glass. After i dropped my phone it shattered and literally cut me bc of the sharp pieces. The other thing that I don't like is when an iPhone dies it takes awhile to turn back on unlike other smart phones as soon as u plug the device into an outlet they turn on. What i specifically like about my iPhone is that it links right up to my mac. This comes in very handy! I like that it is fast and does not get viruses my smart phone prior to my iPhone did get a virus :(
11417,"I had this phone for almost 4 years and honestly it held up pretty good. I have since upgraded to a 6, which I love, but the 4s wasn't really all that different. The newer one is just cleaner and looks nicer."
11418,"I have had this phone for 2 years and I love it.  Can't wait to upgrade though.  I am APPLE all the way, baby!"
11419,"When I first got the phone, I loved it. Now, almost three years later, it has got to go. It's always crashing, loosing my contacts. I'm definitely ready for any upgrade. "
11420,"I've only had this phone for a year and it's already showing signs of malfunction(I haven't even dropped it!). While I love the sleek look, siri, camera, FaceTime and it's simplicity, I thought for the price they should function properly for a longer period of time."
11421,"Any iPhone is great. There are too many perks and the only downside is the phone's prone to breaking. This issue, however, can be easily fixed with an otterbox or bumpercase."
11422,"It worked for me great but then I dropped it in the toilet and had to have it replaced, the refurbished phone they replaced it with was not half as good as my original. I held out for over two years and finally just replaced it with the iphone 6 and LOVE it!"
11423,"I used to have this phone. It worked okay for me. The service was really bad though, and the updates always seemed to crash my phone."
11424,I love my phone but seems that it has started messing up! Not sure if it is the phone or the service company!!!
11425,"Mine is starting to slow down. This is my first iphone, and i don't think I can ever get a phone that's not an iphone. It's very user friendly."
11426,The length of this phone is too little. There is no in between when using your fingers on the touchscreen and you have to use two hands to conduct your business.
11427,Great phone.  super durable and the battery wasn't too horrible.  it wasn't too small or too huge.
11428,"Great phone, had this before upgrading to the 5. It never let me down. I love iphones"
11429,"I love my 4s. Though the newer versions are cool and get a lot of hype I feel no reason to upgrade. This phone is sturdy and does everything I need it to, it's lasted a long time and is an awesome phone."
11430,I have been very happy with my iPhone 4s. My only complaint might be the battery life but that's a common complaint of all iPhones.  
11431,"A bit too slow for me. The battery isn't as bad as the iPhone 5, but still bad. "
11432,"I got this phone when it first came out and it was perfect, but it's getting a bit older so the battery sucks and it's slow, ready to upgrade for sure."
11433,"I used this phone after my Samsung S3 broke, and I liked it a lot better than I thought I would. It's super easy to use "
11434,"I have had this phone for almost two years and have never had a problem with it. It runs well, fast, and I like that it's not a super big phone. 16GB to of memory is perfect for me. I used to have an android and it was okay but after getting an iPhone, I was sold. I will never go back to android."
11435,"I hate this phone. I had the galaxy 4 s, and had to get a new phone. Since having this phone, EVERY TIME, i need to use gps, it shuts downthe app. "
11436,Apple iPhone 4s is a great phone it's just ashame you can't update to iOS 8 I buy it just before 5 came out and didn't know that you wouldn't be able to update it!
11437,"IPhone 4s great quality phone, long lasting life, great battery system so many different games and apps that can be downloaded for free on the App Store I'd buy it over and over again best choice ever made over Samsung "
11438,"This is a great phone! I bought it right after it was presented, but unfortunately is beginning to get old, and needs replacement"
11439,"Had one, it's a great phone!! Good picture quality, easy sharing. Just hate that they shatter!! :("
11440,Such a great phone & was my second phone in hs lol my first was the iPhone 3GS I've always been a apple girl
11441,Had one for a little over a year. pretty impressive at the time. powerful phone l. sturdy if it was in a case...
11442,Apple iPhone's have their downfalls but I absolutely love my iPhone 4s. This phone has been though hell and back yet still works like a charm. The technology is improving but this phone is still showing that it has some spunk left in it. I don't plan on upgrading to a more recent iPhone unless my 4s becomes inoperable. 
11443,Great phone to have. Gets slow and freezes once it gets over a a few yes old
11444,I loved this phone. The only reason I got rid of it was to upgrade to the 5s
11445,"I loved this phone, but needed more space and upgraded to the iPhone 6!!! I love apple products. "
11446,I phones are not that big but they are awesome phones i love them and my sister has it and she adores it
11447,Love my iPhone 4s it's dependable and lightweight. Love all my apple products. Will only upgrade when this one stops working
11448,This phone served me very well for several years. In my opinion this is the optimal size for a phone. I only wish it would have handled the newer upgrades better. 
11449,"I actually have this product and, it's been 2 years i believe. Lately it's just been having so many issues and has been dropping my calls a lot lately and it hasn't done that before. It's probably about that time for me to upgrade. "
11450,I like my iphone 4s. I have had it for a couple of years now. I hate that after awhile of owning the battery life doesn't maintain. and I run out of upgrade room 
11451,Im starting to have a love hate relationship with my Iphone. With many of my friends switching I'm boarderline confused with this company. They do cutting edge new technology but somehow don't know how to make phones that don't have a dying battery life after 1.5 years of owning them. My phone shoots from 60% down to 24% then somehow will sit at 1% for a while or just randomly die at around 20 percent. these phones batteries seem to get a mind of their own. Besides the batter however I do enjoy the way the phones platforms run and the simplicity of the phone!
11452,"I loved my iPhone 4s, until I got the 5s. It's great it runs fast, but you can't beat updated features. I'd rather spring for the 5s then buy a 4. "
11453,The camera has good quality! I love that the betery last so long and I love that it runs fast and it look so cute ! 
11454,I love this phone!!! The only thing I hate about apple is all the good apps you have to buy...
11455,"I used to have this phone until i gave it to a company to fix the home button cause it got stuck a lot and they ended up breaking the motherboard and it was not backed up to icloud. so, iphone down, i almost cried other than that, great starter phone to kids who deserve it!!!"
11456,I love this phone I loved the style of it never have had any problems in fact I'm using it right now. :)
11457,Like the battery life like thats its easy to use .only issue is that its hard for my candy crush game to load from fb
